[description for function: find_pair_with_sum]
This function takes a sorted list and a target sum as inputs, aiming to find a pair of numbers within the list that add up to the target sum. It uses a two-pointer approach, initializing one pointer at the beginning and the other at the end of the list. As it iterates, it calculates the sum of the values at these pointers and compares it to the target sum. If a match is found, it returns the pair; if the current sum is less than the target, it moves the left pointer to the right to increase the sum, and if it's greater, it moves the right pointer to the left to decrease the sum. The process continues until the pointers meet, at which point it returns None if no pair is found. This method is efficient, operating in linear time due to the sorted nature of the input list.
