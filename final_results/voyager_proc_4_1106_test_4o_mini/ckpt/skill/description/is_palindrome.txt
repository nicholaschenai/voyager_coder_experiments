[description for function: is_palindrome]
This function checks if a given string is a palindrome, which means it reads the same forwards and backwards. It first normalizes the string by converting it to lowercase and filtering out non-alphanumeric characters. Then, it compares the filtered string to its reverse. If both are identical, it returns True, indicating that the string is a palindrome; otherwise, it returns False. The function effectively ignores case and punctuation, focusing solely on the alphanumeric content. This makes it suitable for checking phrases and sentences as well as single words.
