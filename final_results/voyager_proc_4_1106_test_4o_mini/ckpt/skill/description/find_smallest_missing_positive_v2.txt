[description for function: find_smallest_missing_positive]
This function identifies the smallest positive integer that is not present in a given list of numbers. It first filters the list to retain only positive integers and stores them in a set for efficient lookup. Starting from the integer 1, it checks sequentially to see if each integer is present in the set. If an integer is found in the set, it increments the integer and continues the search. The process repeats until it finds an integer that is not in the set. Finally, it returns this smallest missing positive integer.
