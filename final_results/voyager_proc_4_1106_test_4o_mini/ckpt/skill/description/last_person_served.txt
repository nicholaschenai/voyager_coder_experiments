[description for function: last_person_served]
The function processes a list of ticket numbers using a queue structure to simulate a serving line. It repeatedly removes the first ticket number until only one remains in the queue. The final ticket number left in the queue is then returned as the result. This effectively identifies the last person who would be served based on the initial order of ticket numbers. The function utilizes a deque for efficient removal of elements from the front of the queue. Overall, it provides a straightforward solution to determine the last ticket holder in a serving scenario.
