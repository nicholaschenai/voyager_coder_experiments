[description for function: merge_sort]
This function sorts an array using the merge sort algorithm, which is a divide-and-conquer approach. It first checks if the array has one or fewer elements, in which case it is already sorted and returned. If the array has more elements, it splits the array into two halves and recursively sorts each half. After sorting both halves, it merges them back together in sorted order. The merging process involves comparing elements from both halves and combining them into a new sorted list. The final result is a fully sorted array.
