        "Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the largest product that can be obtained by multiplying any two numbers from the list.",
        "Write a Python function that takes a sorted list of integers and an integer target value, and returns a tuple of two numbers from the list that add up to the target value. If no such pair exists, return None.",
        "Write a Python function that takes a list of strings representing a postfix expression (each element being a number or an operator) and returns the result of the expression. The function should handle the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.",
        "Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence. The sequence must be composed of consecutive integers, regardless of their order in the original list.",
        "Write a Python function that takes a string and returns a dictionary where each key is a unique word in the string and the corresponding value is the number of times that word appears in the string. The function should ignore case and punctuation.",
        "Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing the difference between each adjacent pair of numbers. The output list should have one less element than the input list.",
        "Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the maximum product of two distinct elements in the list. The function should handle lists with at least two integers.",
        "Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the number of elements in the list that are greater than the sum of all previous elements in the list. For example, in the list [1, 2, 4, 1, 6], the elements 4 and 6 are greater than the sum of all previous elements (1+2 and 1+2+4+1, respectively).",
        "Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the longest subarray where the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the subarray is at most 1. The function should return the length of this subarray.",
        "Write a Python function that takes a string and returns the longest palindrome that can be formed by rearranging its letters. If it is not possible to form any palindrome, return an empty string.",
        "Write a Python function that takes a string and returns the length of the longest substring with at most two distinct characters. For example, given the string 'aabacbebebe', the longest substring with at most two distinct characters is 'cbebebe', so the function should return 7.",
        "Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the length of the longest subarray where the sum of the elements is equal to zero. If no such subarray exists, return 0.",
        "Write a Python function that takes an array of non-negative integers representing the amount of time it takes to complete a task and an integer k representing the number of workers. The function should assign tasks to workers such that the time to complete all tasks is minimized assuming each worker can only work on one task at a time. The function should return the minimum time required to complete all tasks.",
        "Write a Python function that takes the root node of a binary tree and returns True if it is a valid binary search tree (BST), and False otherwise. A valid BST is one where for every node, the values of all the nodes in its left subtree are less than its value, and the values of all the nodes in its right subtree are greater than its value.",
        "Write a Python function that takes a string and an integer `k`, and returns the length of the longest substring with exactly `k` distinct characters. If `k` is 0 or the string is empty, return 0.",
        "Write a Python function that takes two arguments: a list of integers representing a stream of numbers and an integer representing a new number to be added to the stream. The function should return the median of the updated stream. The function should use a min-heap and a max-heap to efficiently find the median after each insertion."
