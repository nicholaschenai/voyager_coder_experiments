Write a python function that returns the number of integer elements in a given list.

"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/253 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of counting the number of integer elements in a given list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function, for example, `count_integer`, that takes a list as an argument.

2. **Initialize a Counter**: Inside the function, initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of integer elements.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to iterate through each element in the list.

4. **Check for Integer Type**: For each element, check if it is of type `int` using the `isinstance()` function.

5. **Update the Counter**: If an element is an integer, increment the counter by one.

6. **Return the Counter**: After the loop, return the counter which now holds the count of integer elements.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def count_integer(lst):
    count = 0
    for element in lst:
        if isinstance(element, int):
            count += 1
    return count
```

This function can then be tested with the provided assertion to ensure it works correctly.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
