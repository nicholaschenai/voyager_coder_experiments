"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/721 [generation text] Answer: To solve the problem of finding the path with the maximum average cost in a square matrix, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of how to accomplish this task:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find a path from the top-left corner of the matrix to the bottom-right corner, moving only right or down. The goal is to maximize the average cost of the cells visited along this path.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We can create a 2D list (or table) `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will store the maximum total cost to reach cell `(i, j)` and the number of cells visited to reach that cell. This will help us calculate the average later.

3. **Initialization**: Start by initializing `dp[0][0]` with the cost of the top-left cell and set the number of cells visited to 1.

4. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - Iterate through each cell in the matrix.
   - For each cell `(i, j)`, check the cells from which it can be reached: `(i-1, j)` (from above) and `(i, j-1)` (from the left).
   - Update `dp[i][j]` by considering the maximum total cost from the reachable cells and adding the current cell's cost. Also, update the count of cells visited.

5. **Calculating the Maximum Average**: Once the `dp` table is filled, the maximum average can be calculated by iterating through the last cell `dp[N-1][N-1]`, which contains the total cost and the number of cells visited to reach the bottom-right corner. The average is computed as `total_cost / number_of_cells`.

6. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the maximum average found.

Hereâ€™s a high-level pseudocode to illustrate the above steps:

```python
def maxAverageOfPath(matrix):
    N = len(matrix)
    dp = [[(0, 0) for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]  # (total_cost, num_cells)
    
    dp[0][0] = (matrix[0][0], 1)  # Initialize the starting point
    
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if i == 0 and j == 0:
                continue  # Skip the starting cell
            max_cost, num_cells = 0, 0
            
            if i > 0:  # From above
                max_cost, num_cells = max(max_cost, dp[i-1][j][0]), dp[i-1][j][1]
            if j > 0:  # From left
                if dp[i][j-1][0] > max_cost:
                    max_cost, num_cells = dp[i][j-1][0], dp[i][j-1][1]
            
            dp[i][j] = (max_cost + matrix[i][j], num_cells + 1)
    
    total_cost, num_cells = dp[N-1][N-1]
    return total_cost / num_cells  # Calculate the average
```

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum average path cost while adhering to the movement constraints.

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.
