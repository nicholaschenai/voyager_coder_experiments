"""
Write a function to find cubes of individual elements in a list.

"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/447 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the cubes of individual elements in a list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function named `cube_nums` that takes a list as an argument.

2. **Iterate Over the List**: Use a loop (like a `for` loop) to iterate over each element in the input list.

3. **Calculate the Cube**: For each element, calculate its cube by raising it to the power of 3 (using the exponentiation operator `**`).

4. **Store the Results**: Create a new list to store the cubes of the elements.

5. **Return the Result**: After the loop, return the new list containing the cubes.

6. **Assertion**: Use an assertion to check if the output of your function matches the expected result.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def cube_nums(numbers):
    return [x ** 3 for x in numbers]

# Example usage
assert cube_nums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == [1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000]
```

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
