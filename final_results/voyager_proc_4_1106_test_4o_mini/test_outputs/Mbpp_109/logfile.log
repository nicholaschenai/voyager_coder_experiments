"""
Write a python function to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times.
assert odd_Equivalent("011001",6) == 3
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/109 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string a given number of times, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understanding Binary Strings**: A binary string consists of '0's and '1's. Each rotation of the string shifts the characters to the left or right, wrapping around the ends.

2. **Rotating the String**: You need to create a function that can rotate the binary string. For a string of length `n`, rotating it `k` times can be achieved by slicing the string. For example, rotating left by one position can be done by taking the substring from index 1 to the end and appending the first character.

3. **Converting to Integer**: After each rotation, convert the resulting binary string to an integer using Python's built-in `int()` function with base 2.

4. **Checking for Odd Values**: An integer is odd if it is not divisible by 2. You can check this using the modulus operator `%`.

5. **Counting Odd Values**: Maintain a count of how many of the rotated values are odd. You can use a set to store unique values to avoid counting duplicates.

6. **Iterating Through Rotations**: Loop through the number of rotations specified, applying the rotation and checking the oddness of the resulting integer.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def odd_Equivalent(binary_string, rotations):
    unique_values = set()
    n = len(binary_string)
    
    for i in range(rotations):
        # Rotate the string
        rotated_string = binary_string[i % n:] + binary_string[:i % n]
        # Convert to integer
        value = int(rotated_string, 2)
        # Add to the set if it's odd
        if value % 2 != 0:
            unique_values.add(value)
    
    # Return the count of unique odd values
    return len(unique_values)
```

This function will return the number of unique odd integers obtained from the rotations of the binary string. The assertion `assert odd_Equivalent("011001", 6) == 3` checks that the function behaves as expected for the given input.

At each round of conversation, I will give you

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

Write a python function to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times.

"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string a given number of times, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understanding Binary Strings**: A binary string consists of '0's and '1's. Each rotation of the string shifts the characters to the left or right, wrapping around the ends.

2. **Rotating the String**: You need to create a function that can rotate the binary string. For a string of length `n`, rotating it `k` times can be achieved by slicing the string. For example, rotating left by one position can be done by taking the substring from index 1 to the end and appending the first character.

3. **Converting to Integer**: After each rotation, convert the resulting binary string to an integer using Python's built-in `int()` function with base 2.

4. **Checking for Odd Values**: An integer is odd if it is not divisible by 2. You can check this using the modulus operator `%`.

5. **Counting Odd Values**: Maintain a count of how many of the rotated values are odd. You can use a set to store unique values to avoid counting duplicates.

6. **Iterating Through Rotations**: Loop through the number of rotations specified, applying the rotation and checking the oddness of the resulting integer.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def odd_Equivalent(binary_string, rotations):
    unique_values = set()
    n = len(binary_string)
    
    for i in range(rotations):
        # Rotate the string
        rotated_string = binary_string[i % n:] + binary_string[:i % n]
        # Convert to integer
        value = int(rotated_string, 2)
        # Add to the set if it's odd
        if value % 2 != 0:
            unique_values.add(value)
    
    # Return the count of unique odd values
    return len(unique_values)
```

This function will return the number of unique odd integers obtained from the rotations of the binary string. The assertion `assert odd_Equivalent("011001", 6) == 3` checks that the function behaves as expected for the given input.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/109 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct and outlines the necessary steps to solve the problem. It correctly identifies the need to rotate the binary string, convert it to an integer, check for odd values, and count unique odd integers. However, the plan does not explicitly mention that the number of rotations can exceed the length of the string, which means we should only consider unique rotations up to the length of the string.

Plan:
1) Define a function `odd_Equivalent` that takes a binary string and a number of rotations as input.
2) Initialize a set to store unique odd integer values.
3) Calculate the length of the binary string.
4) Loop through the range of the minimum of the number of rotations and the length of the string to avoid unnecessary rotations.
5) For each rotation, create the rotated string by slicing.
6) Convert the rotated string to an integer using base 2.
7) Check if the integer is odd and add it to the set if it is.
8) Return the size of the set, which represents the count of unique odd integers.
