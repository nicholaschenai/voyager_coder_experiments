"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/743 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of rotating a list to the right by a specified number of items in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand the Rotation**: When you rotate a list to the right, the elements at the end of the list move to the front. For example, rotating the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` by 2 positions to the right results in `[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]`.

2. **Calculate Effective Rotations**: If the number of rotations exceeds the length of the list, you can reduce the number of rotations by taking the modulus of the length of the list. For example, rotating a list of length 10 by 12 positions is equivalent to rotating it by 2 positions (`12 % 10 = 2`).

3. **Slice the List**: You can use list slicing to rearrange the elements. The last `n` elements of the list can be obtained using slicing, and the remaining elements can be obtained by slicing from the start of the list up to the point where the last `n` elements start.

4. **Combine the Slices**: Concatenate the two slices to form the rotated list.

5. **Implement the Function**: Write a function that takes the list and the number of positions to rotate as arguments, applies the above logic, and returns the new rotated list.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def rotate_right(lst, n):
    n = n % len(lst)  # Step 2: Calculate effective rotations
    return lst[-n:] + lst[:-n]  # Step 4: Combine the slices
```

This function will achieve the desired rotation as specified in the assertion.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of rotating a list to the right by a specified number of items in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand the Rotation**: When you rotate a list to the right, the elements at the end of the list move to the front. For example, rotating the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` by 2 positions to the right results in `[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]`.

2. **Calculate Effective Rotations**: If the number of rotations exceeds the length of the list, you can reduce the number of rotations by taking the modulus of the length of the list. For example, rotating a list of length 10 by 12 positions is equivalent to rotating it by 2 positions (`12 % 10 = 2`).

3. **Slice the List**: You can use list slicing to rearrange the elements. The last `n` elements of the list can be obtained using slicing, and the remaining elements can be obtained by slicing from the start of the list up to the point where the last `n` elements start.

4. **Combine the Slices**: Concatenate the two slices to form the rotated list.

5. **Implement the Function**: Write a function that takes the list and the number of positions to rotate as arguments, applies the above logic, and returns the new rotated list.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def rotate_right(lst, n):
    n = n % len(lst)  # Step 2: Calculate effective rotations
    return lst[-n:] + lst[:-n]  # Step 4: Combine the slices
```

This function will achieve the desired rotation as specified in the assertion.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/743 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided in the context is mostly correct and outlines the necessary steps to rotate a list to the right. It correctly identifies the need to handle cases where the number of rotations exceeds the length of the list and suggests using slicing to rearrange the elements. However, it does not explicitly mention handling the case where the input list is empty, which could lead to an error when trying to calculate the modulus or perform slicing.

Plan:
1) Define the function `rotate_right` that takes a list and an integer as arguments.
2) Check if the list is empty; if it is, return the empty list immediately.
3) Calculate the effective number of rotations using the modulus operator with the length of the list.
4) Use list slicing to create two parts: the last `n` elements and the rest of the list.
5) Concatenate the two slices and return the resulting list.

Code:
```python
def rotate_right(lst, n):
    if not lst:  # Step 2: Handle empty list
        return lst
    n = n % len(lst)  # Step 3: Calculate effective rotations
