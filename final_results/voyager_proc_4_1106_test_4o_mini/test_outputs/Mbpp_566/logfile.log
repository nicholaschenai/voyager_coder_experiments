"""
Write a function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.
assert sum_digits(345)==12
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/566 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of writing a function that calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function named `sum_digits` that takes a single parameter, which will be the non-negative integer.

2. **Convert the Integer to String**: Convert the integer to a string. This allows you to iterate over each digit easily.

3. **Iterate Over Each Character**: Use a loop to go through each character in the string representation of the integer.

4. **Convert Characters Back to Integers**: For each character (which represents a digit), convert it back to an integer.

5. **Sum the Digits**: Keep a running total of the sum of these integer values.

6. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the computed sum.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def sum_digits(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))

# Example usage
assert sum_digits(345) == 12
```

In this implementation, the `sum` function is used along with a generator expression that converts each digit back to an integer and sums them up. The `assert` statement checks that the function works correctly for the given test case.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
