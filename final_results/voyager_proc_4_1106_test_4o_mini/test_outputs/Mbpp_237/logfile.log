You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

Answer: To accomplish the task of counting the occurrences of each unique tuple in a list and returning a dictionary with the counts, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Initialize a Dictionary**: Start by creating an empty dictionary that will hold the tuples as keys and their counts as values.

You are a Python programming assistant that assesses my progress of Python programming and provides useful guidance.

I will give you the following information:

[Task]: The objective I need to accomplish.
[Context]: The context of the task. Serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help me on the task, but my priority is to follow instructions in the Task tag.
[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of counting the occurrences of each unique tuple in a list and returning a dictionary with the counts, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Initialize a Dictionary**: Start by creating an empty dictionary that will hold the tuples as keys and their counts as values.

2. **Iterate Through the List**: Loop through each tuple in the provided list.

3. **Count Occurrences**: For each tuple, check if it is already a key in the dictionary:
   - If it is, increment its count by 1.
   - If it is not, add it to the dictionary with a count of 1.

4. **Return the Dictionary**: After processing all tuples, return the dictionary containing the counts of each unique tuple.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def check_occurences(tuples_list):
    occurrences = {}  # Step 1: Initialize an empty dictionary
    for tup in tuples_list:  # Step 2: Iterate through the list
        if tup in occurrences:  # Step 3: Check if the tuple is already in the dictionary
            occurrences[tup] += 1  # Increment the count
        else:
            occurrences[tup] = 1  # Add the tuple with a count of 1
    return occurrences  # Step 4: Return the dictionary
```

This function will effectively count how many times each unique tuple appears in the input list and return the desired dictionary. Note that the assertion in your question seems to have a mistake in the expected output; the correct output should reflect the actual counts based on the input list.


[Critique]
To fix the implementation, you need to ensure that tuples are treated as equivalent regardless of their order. One way to achieve this is to sort the tuples before counting them. You can modify the line where you check for occurrences to use a sorted version of the tuple, like this: occurrences[tuple(sorted(tup))] += 1. This way, both (3, 1) and (1, 3) will be counted as the same tuple.


INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/237 [generation text] Explain: The current implementation of the `check_occurences` function counts occurrences of tuples as they are, without considering that tuples like (3, 1) and (1, 3) should be treated as equivalent. To fix this, we need to sort the tuples before counting them, ensuring that both (3, 1) and (1, 3) are counted together.

Plan:
1) Initialize an empty dictionary to store the occurrences of each unique tuple.
2) Iterate through each tuple in the input list.
3) For each tuple, sort it to ensure that tuples with the same elements in different orders are treated as the same.
4) Check if the sorted tuple is already in the dictionary:
   - If it is, increment its count.
   - If it is not, add it to the dictionary with a count of 1.
5) Return the dictionary containing the counts of each unique tuple.

Code:
```python
def check_occurences(tuples_list):
    occurrences = {}
    for tup in tuples_list:
        sorted_tup = tuple(sorted(tup))  # Sort the tuple to treat (a, b) and (b, a) as the same
