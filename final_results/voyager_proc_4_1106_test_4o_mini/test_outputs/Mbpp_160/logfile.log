"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/160 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding integers \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy the equation \( ax + by = n \), you can use the concept of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of how to implement this in Python:

1. **Understanding the Equation**: The equation \( ax + by = n \) is a linear Diophantine equation. A solution exists if and only if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( a \) and \( b \) divides \( n \).

2. **Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm**: This algorithm not only computes the gcd of two integers \( a \) and \( b \) but also finds integers \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \) such that \( ax_0 + by_0 = \text{gcd}(a, b) \). If \( d = \text{gcd}(a, b) \) divides \( n \), then you can scale \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \) by \( n/d \) to find a particular solution to the equation.

3. **Finding General Solutions**: The general solution can be expressed as:
   - \( x = x_0 + (b/d)t \)
   - \( y = y_0 - (a/d)t \)
   where \( t \) is any integer. You can adjust \( t \) to find different integer solutions.

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Define a function `find_solution(a, b, n)`.
   - Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \).
   - Check if \( n \) is divisible by \( d \). If not, return `None`.
   - Scale \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \) by \( n/d \) to get a particular solution.
   - Optionally, return the solution as a tuple \( (x, y) \).

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation outline:

```python
def extended_gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a, 1, 0
    gcd, x1, y1 = extended_gcd(b, a % b)
    x = y1
    y = x1 - (a // b) * y1
    return gcd, x, y

def find_solution(a, b, n):
    gcd, x0, y0 = extended_gcd(a, b)
    if n % gcd != 0:
        return None  # No solution exists
    # Scale the solution
    x = x0 * (n // gcd)
    y = y0 * (n // gcd)
    return (x, y)

# Example usage
assert find_solution(2, 3, 7) == (2, 1)
```

This function will return the integers \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy the equation or `None` if no solution exists.

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding integers \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy the equation \( ax + by = n \), you can use the concept of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of how to implement this in Python:

1. **Understanding the Equation**: The equation \( ax + by = n \) is a linear Diophantine equation. A solution exists if and only if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( a \) and \( b \) divides \( n \).

2. **Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm**: This algorithm not only computes the gcd of two integers \( a \) and \( b \) but also finds integers \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \) such that \( ax_0 + by_0 = \text{gcd}(a, b) \). If \( d = \text{gcd}(a, b) \) divides \( n \), then you can scale \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \) by \( n/d \) to find a particular solution to the equation.

3. **Finding General Solutions**: The general solution can be expressed as:
   - \( x = x_0 + (b/d)t \)
   - \( y = y_0 - (a/d)t \)
   where \( t \) is any integer. You can adjust \( t \) to find different integer solutions.

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Define a function `find_solution(a, b, n)`.
   - Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \).
   - Check if \( n \) is divisible by \( d \). If not, return `None`.
   - Scale \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \) by \( n/d \) to get a particular solution.
   - Optionally, return the solution as a tuple \( (x, y) \).

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation outline:

```python
def extended_gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a, 1, 0
    gcd, x1, y1 = extended_gcd(b, a % b)
    x = y1
    y = x1 - (a // b) * y1
    return gcd, x, y

def find_solution(a, b, n):
    gcd, x0, y0 = extended_gcd(a, b)
    if n % gcd != 0:
        return None  # No solution exists
    # Scale the solution
    x = x0 * (n // gcd)
    y = y0 * (n // gcd)
    return (x, y)

# Example usage
assert find_solution(2, 3, 7) == (2, 1)
```

This function will return the integers \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy the equation or `None` if no solution exists.

[Context]: 
 Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding integers \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy the equation \( ax + by = n \), you can use the concept of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of how to implement this in Python:

1. **Understanding the Equation**: The equation \( ax + by = n \) is a linear Diophantine equation. A solution exists if and only if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( a \) and \( b \) divides \( n \).

2. **Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm**: This algorithm not only computes the gcd of two integers \( a \) and \( b \) but also finds integers \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \) such that \( ax_0 + by_0 = \text{gcd}(a, b) \). If \( d = \text{gcd}(a, b) \) divides \( n \), then you can scale \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \) by \( n/d \) to find a particular solution to the equation.

3. **Finding General Solutions**: The general solution can be expressed as:
   - \( x = x_0 + (b/d)t \)
   - \( y = y_0 - (a/d)t \)
   where \( t \) is any integer. You can adjust \( t \) to find different integer solutions.

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Define a function `find_solution(a, b, n)`.
   - Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \).
   - Check if \( n \) is divisible by \( d \). If not, return `None`.
   - Scale \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \) by \( n/d \) to get a particular solution.
   - Optionally, return the solution as a tuple \( (x, y) \).

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation outline:

```python
def extended_gcd(a, b):

        return a, 1, 0
    gcd, x1, y1 = extended_gcd(b, a % b)

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding integers \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy the equation \( ax + by = n \), you can use the concept of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of how to implement this in Python:

1. **Understanding the Equation**: The equation \( ax + by = n \) is a linear Diophantine equation. A solution exists if and only if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( a \) and \( b \) divides \( n \).

2. **Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm**: This algorithm not only computes the gcd of two integers \( a \) and \( b \) but also finds integers \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \) such that \( ax_0 + by_0 = \text{gcd}(a, b) \). If \( d = \text{gcd}(a, b) \) divides \( n \), then you can scale \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \) by \( n/d \) to find a particular solution to the equation.

3. **Finding General Solutions**: The general solution can be expressed as:
   - \( x = x_0 + (b/d)t \)
   - \( y = y_0 - (a/d)t \)
   where \( t \) is any integer. You can adjust \( t \) to find different integer solutions.

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Define a function `find_solution(a, b, n)`.
   - Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \).
   - Check if \( n \) is divisible by \( d \). If not, return `None`.
   - Scale \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \) by \( n/d \) to get a particular solution.
   - Optionally, return the solution as a tuple \( (x, y) \).

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation outline:

```python
def extended_gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a, 1, 0
    gcd, x1, y1 = extended_gcd(b, a % b)
    x = y1
    y = x1 - (a // b) * y1
    return gcd, x, y

def find_solution(a, b, n):
    gcd, x0, y0 = extended_gcd(a, b)
    if n % gcd != 0:
        return None  # No solution exists
    # Scale the solution
    x = x0 * (n // gcd)
    y = y0 * (n // gcd)
    return (x, y)

# Example usage
assert find_solution(2, 3, 7) == (2, 1)
```

This function will return the integers \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy the equation or `None` if no solution exists.


[Critique]
To fix the implementation, ensure that the scaling of x0 and y0 is done correctly. The current implementation returns a solution that does not satisfy the original equation. You may want to check the calculations for x and y after scaling, and ensure that they are derived correctly from the Extended Euclidean Algorithm results. Additionally, consider adjusting the values of x and y based on the gcd to ensure they meet the equation ax + by = n.

1. **Understanding the Equation**: The equation \( ax + by = n \) is a linear Diophantine equation. A solution exists if and only if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( a \) and \( b \) divides \( n \).

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Define a function `find_solution(a, b, n)`.
   - Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \).
   - Check if \( n \) is divisible by \( d \). If not, return `None`.
   - Scale \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \) by \( n/d \) to get a particular solution.
   - Optionally, return the solution as a tuple \( (x, y) \).

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation outline:

```python
def extended_gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a, 1, 0
    gcd, x1, y1 = extended_gcd(b, a % b)
    x = y1
    y = x1 - (a // b) * y1
    return gcd, x, y

def find_solution(a, b, n):
    gcd, x0, y0 = extended_gcd(a, b)
    if n % gcd != 0:
        return None  # No solution exists
    # Scale the solution
    x = x0 * (n // gcd)
    y = y0 * (n // gcd)
    return (x, y)

# Example usage
assert find_solution(2, 3, 7) == (2, 1)
```

This function will return the integers \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy the equation or `None` if no solution exists.


[function impl]:


def extended_gcd(a, b):
    if (b == 0):
        return (a, 1, 0)
    (gcd, x1, y1) = extended_gcd(b, (a % b))
    x = y1
    y = (x1 - ((a // b) * y1))
    return (gcd, x, y)




def find_solution(a: int, b: int, n: int) -> (tuple[(int, int)] | None):
    (gcd, x0, y0) = extended_gcd(a, b)
    if ((n % gcd) != 0):
        return None
    x = (x0 * (n // gcd))
    y = (y0 * (n // gcd))
    return (x, y)

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding integers \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy the equation \( ax + by = n \), you can use the concept of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of how to implement this in Python:

1. **Understanding the Equation**: The equation \( ax + by = n \) is a linear Diophantine equation. A solution exists if and only if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( a \) and \( b \) divides \( n \).

2. **Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm**: This algorithm not only computes the gcd of two integers \( a \) and \( b \) but also finds integers \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \) such that \( ax_0 + by_0 = \text{gcd}(a, b) \). If \( d = \text{gcd}(a, b) \) divides \( n \), then you can scale \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \) by \( n/d \) to find a particular solution to the equation.

3. **Finding General Solutions**: The general solution can be expressed as:
   - \( x = x_0 + (b/d)t \)
   - \( y = y_0 - (a/d)t \)
   where \( t \) is any integer. You can adjust \( t \) to find different integer solutions.

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Define a function `find_solution(a, b, n)`.
   - Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \).
   - Check if \( n \) is divisible by \( d \). If not, return `None`.
   - Scale \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \) by \( n/d \) to get a particular solution.
   - Optionally, return the solution as a tuple \( (x, y) \).

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation outline:

```python
def extended_gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a, 1, 0
    gcd, x1, y1 = extended_gcd(b, a % b)
    x = y1
    y = x1 - (a // b) * y1
    return gcd, x, y

def find_solution(a, b, n):
    gcd, x0, y0 = extended_gcd(a, b)
    if n % gcd != 0:
        return None  # No solution exists
    # Scale the solution
    x = x0 * (n // gcd)
    y = y0 * (n // gcd)
    return (x, y)

# Example usage
assert find_solution(2, 3, 7) == (2, 1)
```

This function will return the integers \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy the equation or `None` if no solution exists.


[Critique]
To fix the implementation, ensure that the scaling of x0 and y0 is done correctly. The current implementation returns a solution that does not satisfy the original equation. You may want to check the calculations for x and y after scaling, and ensure that they are derived correctly from the Extended Euclidean Algorithm results. Additionally, consider adjusting the values of x and y based on the gcd to ensure they meet the equation ax + by = n.

Answer: To accomplish the task of finding integers \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy the equation \( ax + by = n \), you can use the concept of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of how to implement this in Python:

1. **Understanding the Equation**: The equation \( ax + by = n \) is a linear Diophantine equation. A solution exists if and only if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( a \) and \( b \) divides \( n \).

2. **Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm**: This algorithm not only computes the gcd of two integers \( a \) and \( b \) but also finds integers \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \) such that \( ax_0 + by_0 = \text{gcd}(a, b) \). If \( d = \text{gcd}(a, b) \) divides \( n \), then you can scale \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \) by \( n/d \) to find a particular solution to the equation.

3. **Finding General Solutions**: The general solution can be expressed as:
   - \( x = x_0 + (b/d)t \)
   - \( y = y_0 - (a/d)t \)
   where \( t \) is any integer. You can adjust \( t \) to find different integer solutions.

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Define a function `find_solution(a, b, n)`.
   - Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \).
   - Check if \( n \) is divisible by \( d \). If not, return `None`.
   - Scale \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \) by \( n/d \) to get a particular solution.
   - Optionally, return the solution as a tuple \( (x, y) \).

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation outline:

```python
def extended_gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a, 1, 0
    gcd, x1, y1 = extended_gcd(b, a % b)
    x = y1
    y = x1 - (a // b) * y1
    return gcd, x, y

def find_solution(a, b, n):
    gcd, x0, y0 = extended_gcd(a, b)
    if n % gcd != 0:
        return None  # No solution exists
    # Scale the solution
    x = x0 * (n // gcd)
    y = y0 * (n // gcd)
    return (x, y)

# Example usage
assert find_solution(2, 3, 7) == (2, 1)
```

This function will return the integers \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy the equation or `None` if no solution exists.


[function impl]:


def extended_gcd(a, b):
    if (b == 0):
        return (a, 1, 0)
    (gcd, x1, y1) = extended_gcd(b, (a % b))
    x = y1
    y = (x1 - ((a // b) * y1))
    return (gcd, x, y)




def find_solution(a: int, b: int, n: int) -> (tuple[(int, int)] | None):
    (gcd, x0, y0) = extended_gcd(a, b)
    if ((n % gcd) != 0):
        return None
    x = (x0 * (n // gcd))
    y = (y0 * (n // gcd))
    return (x, y)

[Critique]
To fix the implementation, ensure that the scaling of x0 and y0 is done correctly. The current implementation returns a solution that does not satisfy the original equation. You may want to check the calculations for x and y after scaling, and ensure that they are derived correctly from the Extended Euclidean Algorithm results. Additionally, consider adjusting the values of x and y based on the gcd to ensure they meet the equation ax + by = n.

    "critique": "The issue stems from the while loop while current_sum + nums[right] <= target:, which directly accesses nums[right] without checking if right is within the bounds of the list. This results in a runtime error when right goes beyond the list length. To overcome this error, we need to add a bounds check for the right variable in the mentioned while loop. We can modify the loop condition to while right < len(nums) and current_sum + nums[right] <= target:. This change will ensure that we only access elements within the bounds of the list, thus avoiding the IndexError."

Write a function that returns integers x and y that satisfy ax + by = n as a tuple, or return None if no solution exists.

[Context]: 
 Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding integers \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy the equation \( ax + by = n \), you can use the concept of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of how to implement this in Python:

1. **Understanding the Equation**: The equation \( ax + by = n \) is a linear Diophantine equation. A solution exists if and only if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( a \) and \( b \) divides \( n \).

2. **Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm**: This algorithm not only computes the gcd of two integers \( a \) and \( b \) but also finds integers \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \) such that \( ax_0 + by_0 = \text{gcd}(a, b) \). If \( d = \text{gcd}(a, b) \) divides \( n \), then you can scale \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \) by \( n/d \) to find a particular solution to the equation.

3. **Finding General Solutions**: The general solution can be expressed as:
   - \( x = x_0 + (b/d)t \)
   - \( y = y_0 - (a/d)t \)
   where \( t \) is any integer. You can adjust \( t \) to find different integer solutions.

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Define a function `find_solution(a, b, n)`.
   - Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \).
   - Check if \( n \) is divisible by \( d \). If not, return `None`.
   - Scale \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \) by \( n/d \) to get a particular solution.
   - Optionally, return the solution as a tuple \( (x, y) \).

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation outline:

```python
def extended_gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a, 1, 0
    gcd, x1, y1 = extended_gcd(b, a % b)
    x = y1
    y = x1 - (a // b) * y1
    return gcd, x, y

def find_solution(a, b, n):
    gcd, x0, y0 = extended_gcd(a, b)
    if n % gcd != 0:
        return None  # No solution exists
    # Scale the solution
    x = x0 * (n // gcd)
    y = y0 * (n // gcd)
    return (x, y)

# Example usage
assert find_solution(2, 3, 7) == (2, 1)
```

This function will return the integers \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy the equation or `None` if no solution exists.


[function impl]:


def extended_gcd(a, b):
    if (b == 0):
        return (a, 1, 0)
    (gcd, x1, y1) = extended_gcd(b, (a % b))
    x = y1
    y = (x1 - ((a // b) * y1))
    return (gcd, x, y)




def find_solution(a: int, b: int, n: int) -> (tuple[(int, int)] | None):
    (gcd, x0, y0) = extended_gcd(a, b)
    if ((n % gcd) != 0):
        return None
    x = (x0 * (n // gcd))
    y = (y0 * (n // gcd))
    return (x, y)
