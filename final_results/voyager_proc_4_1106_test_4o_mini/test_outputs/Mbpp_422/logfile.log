"""
Write a python function to find the average of cubes of first n natural numbers.
assert find_Average_Of_Cube(2) == 4.5
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/422 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the average of the cubes of the first n natural numbers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: You need to calculate the average of the cubes of the first n natural numbers. The first n natural numbers are 1, 2, 3, ..., n. The cube of a number x is calculated as x^3.

2. **Calculate the Sum of Cubes**: You can use a loop or a mathematical formula to calculate the sum of the cubes of the first n natural numbers. The formula for the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers is:
   \[
   \text{Sum of cubes} = \left(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   However, for simplicity, you can also calculate it using a loop.

3. **Calculate the Average**: The average is calculated by dividing the sum of the cubes by n.

4. **Implement the Function**: Create a function that takes n as an argument, computes the sum of the cubes, and then calculates the average.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the calculated average.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps in Python:

```python
def find_Average_Of_Cube(n):
    sum_of_cubes = sum(i**3 for i in range(1, n + 1))  # Calculate the sum of cubes
    average = sum_of_cubes / n  # Calculate the average
    return average

# Example usage
assert find_Average_Of_Cube(2) == 4.5
```

In this implementation:
- We use a generator expression to compute the sum of cubes for numbers from 1 to n.
- We then divide the sum by n to get the average and return it. 

This function will correctly compute the average of the cubes of the first n natural numbers.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
