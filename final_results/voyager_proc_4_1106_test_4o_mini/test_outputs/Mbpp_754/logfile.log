INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/754 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding common elements from three lists at the same index in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `extract_index_list` that takes three lists as parameters.

2. **Determine the Length**: Calculate the minimum length of the three lists to ensure you only iterate over valid indices that exist in all three lists.

3. **Iterate Through Indices**: Use a loop to iterate through the indices from 0 to the minimum length minus one.

4. **Check for Common Elements**: For each index, check if the elements at that index in all three lists are the same.

5. **Collect Common Elements**: If the elements are the same, append that element to a result list.

6. **Return the Result**: After the loop, return the list of common elements.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def extract_index_list(l1, l2, l3):
    common_elements = []
    min_length = min(len(l1), len(l2), len(l3))
    
    for i in range(min_length):
        if l1[i] == l2[i] == l3[i]:
            common_elements.append(l1[i])
    
    return common_elements
```

This function will return a list of elements that are common across the three input lists at the same indices. The provided assertion can be used to test the function to ensure it works as expected.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.
