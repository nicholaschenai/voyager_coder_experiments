"""
Write a function to convert tuple string to integer tuple.
assert tuple_str_int("(7, 8, 9)") == (7, 8, 9)
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/785 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of converting a tuple string to an integer tuple in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Input Handling**: The function will take a string representation of a tuple as input. For example, the input will be `"(7, 8, 9)"`.

2. **String Manipulation**: You need to remove the parentheses from the string. This can be done using string slicing or the `strip()` method.

3. **Splitting the String**: After removing the parentheses, you can split the string by commas to get individual string representations of the numbers. This can be achieved using the `split()` method.

4. **Conversion to Integers**: Once you have a list of string numbers, you can convert each string to an integer using the `map()` function or a list comprehension.

5. **Creating a Tuple**: Finally, you can convert the list of integers into a tuple using the `tuple()` constructor.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def tuple_str_int(tuple_str):
    # Step 1: Remove parentheses
    cleaned_str = tuple_str.strip("()")
    
    # Step 2: Split the string by commas
    str_numbers = cleaned_str.split(",")
    
    # Step 3: Convert to integers
    int_numbers = map(int, str_numbers)
    
    # Step 4: Create a tuple
    return tuple(int_numbers)
```

This function will take the input string, process it, and return a tuple of integers as required. The assertion `assert tuple_str_int("(7, 8, 9)") == (7, 8, 9)` will pass if the function is implemented correctly.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of converting a tuple string to an integer tuple in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Input Handling**: The function will take a string representation of a tuple as input. For example, the input will be `"(7, 8, 9)"`.

2. **String Manipulation**: You need to remove the parentheses from the string. This can be done using string slicing or the `strip()` method.

3. **Splitting the String**: After removing the parentheses, you can split the string by commas to get individual string representations of the numbers. This can be achieved using the `split()` method.

4. **Conversion to Integers**: Once you have a list of string numbers, you can convert each string to an integer using the `map()` function or a list comprehension.

5. **Creating a Tuple**: Finally, you can convert the list of integers into a tuple using the `tuple()` constructor.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def tuple_str_int(tuple_str):
    # Step 1: Remove parentheses
    cleaned_str = tuple_str.strip("()")
    
    # Step 2: Split the string by commas
    str_numbers = cleaned_str.split(",")
    
    # Step 3: Convert to integers
    int_numbers = map(int, str_numbers)
    
    # Step 4: Create a tuple
    return tuple(int_numbers)
```

This function will take the input string, process it, and return a tuple of integers as required. The assertion `assert tuple_str_int("(7, 8, 9)") == (7, 8, 9)` will pass if the function is implemented correctly.
