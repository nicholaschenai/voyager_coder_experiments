"""
Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
assert check_Consecutive([1,2,3,4,5]) == True
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/472 [generation text] Answer: To check whether a given list contains consecutive numbers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Sort the List**: First, sort the list of numbers. This will arrange the numbers in ascending order, making it easier to check for consecutiveness.

2. **Check Differences**: After sorting, iterate through the sorted list and check the difference between each consecutive pair of numbers. For a list to contain consecutive numbers, the difference between each pair should be exactly 1.

3. **Return Result**: If all consecutive pairs have a difference of 1, return `True`. If you find any pair that does not meet this condition, return `False`.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic in a Python function:

```python
def check_Consecutive(numbers):
    # Sort the list
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
    
    # Check for consecutive numbers
    for i in range(len(sorted_numbers) - 1):
        if sorted_numbers[i + 1] - sorted_numbers[i] != 1:
            return False
    return True

# Example usage
assert check_Consecutive([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == True
```

This function first sorts the input list and then checks if each number is followed by its consecutive number. If all checks pass, it confirms that the list contains consecutive numbers.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
assert check_Consecutive([1,2,3,4,5]) == True
"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To check whether a given list contains consecutive numbers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Sort the List**: First, sort the list of numbers. This will arrange the numbers in ascending order, making it easier to check for consecutiveness.

2. **Check Differences**: After sorting, iterate through the sorted list and check the difference between each consecutive pair of numbers. For a list to contain consecutive numbers, the difference between each pair should be exactly 1.

3. **Return Result**: If all consecutive pairs have a difference of 1, return `True`. If you find any pair that does not meet this condition, return `False`.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic in a Python function:

```python
def check_Consecutive(numbers):
    # Sort the list
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
    
    # Check for consecutive numbers
    for i in range(len(sorted_numbers) - 1):
        if sorted_numbers[i + 1] - sorted_numbers[i] != 1:
            return False
    return True

# Example usage
assert check_Consecutive([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == True
```

This function first sorts the input list and then checks if each number is followed by its consecutive number. If all checks pass, it confirms that the list contains consecutive numbers.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/472 [generation text] Explain: The provided plan is mostly correct and outlines a clear approach to check for consecutive numbers in a list. However, it does not account for the possibility of duplicate numbers in the list, which would also affect the result. If duplicates are present, the list should not be considered to contain consecutive numbers. 

Plan:
1) Sort the input list to arrange the numbers in ascending order.
2) Iterate through the sorted list and check the difference between each consecutive pair of numbers.
3) If any pair has a difference other than 1, return `False`.
4) Additionally, check for duplicates during the iteration; if a duplicate is found, return `False`.
5) If all checks pass, return `True`.

Code:
```python
def check_Consecutive(numbers):
    # Sort the list
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
    
    # Check for consecutive numbers and duplicates
    for i in range(len(sorted_numbers) - 1):
        if sorted_numbers[i + 1] - sorted_numbers[i] != 1 or sorted_numbers[i] == sorted_numbers[i + 1]:
