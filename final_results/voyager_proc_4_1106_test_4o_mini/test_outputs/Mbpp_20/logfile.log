INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/20 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to check if the given number is woodball or not.
assert is_woodall(383) == True
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/20 [generation text] Answer: To determine if a number is a Woodall number, you need to understand the definition of Woodall numbers. A Woodall number is defined as a number of the form \( n \times 2^n - 1 \), where \( n \) is a non-negative integer.

To accomplish the task in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `is_woodall` that takes a single argument (the number to check).

2. **Generate Woodall Numbers**: Inside the function, you will need to generate Woodall numbers for various values of \( n \) until the generated Woodall number exceeds the given number. This can be done using a loop.

3. **Check for Equality**: For each generated Woodall number, check if it matches the given number. If a match is found, return `True`. If the loop completes without finding a match, return `False`.

4. **Use Assertions**: You can use assertions to test your function, as shown in the example.

Here is a conceptual outline of the code:

```python
def is_woodall(num):
    n = 0
    while True:
        woodall_number = n * (2 ** n) - 1
        if woodall_number == num:
            return True
        elif woodall_number > num:
            return False
        n += 1

# Example usage
assert is_woodall(383) == True
```

This function will check if the given number is a Woodall number by generating Woodall numbers in a loop and comparing them to the input number.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To determine if a number is a Woodall number, you need to understand the definition of Woodall numbers. A Woodall number is defined as a number of the form \( n \times 2^n - 1 \), where \( n \) is a non-negative integer.

To accomplish the task in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `is_woodall` that takes a single argument (the number to check).

2. **Generate Woodall Numbers**: Inside the function, you will need to generate Woodall numbers for various values of \( n \) until the generated Woodall number exceeds the given number. This can be done using a loop.

3. **Check for Equality**: For each generated Woodall number, check if it matches the given number. If a match is found, return `True`. If the loop completes without finding a match, return `False`.

4. **Use Assertions**: You can use assertions to test your function, as shown in the example.

Here is a conceptual outline of the code:

```python
def is_woodall(num):
    n = 0
    while True:
        woodall_number = n * (2 ** n) - 1
        if woodall_number == num:
            return True
        elif woodall_number > num:
            return False
        n += 1

# Example usage
assert is_woodall(383) == True
```

This function will check if the given number is a Woodall number by generating Woodall numbers in a loop and comparing them to the input number.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/20 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct and outlines the necessary steps to determine if a number is a Woodall number. The definition of a Woodall number is accurately described, and the approach to generate Woodall numbers in a loop until exceeding the input number is appropriate. The function will return `True` if a match is found and `False` otherwise.

Plan:
1) Define the function `is_woodall` that takes an integer as input.
2) Initialize a variable `n` to 0 to start generating Woodall numbers.
3) Use a while loop to generate Woodall numbers in the form \( n \times 2^n - 1 \).
4) In each iteration, check if the generated Woodall number equals the input number.
5) If a match is found, return `True`. If the generated number exceeds the input number, return `False`.
6) Increment `n` in each iteration to generate the next Woodall number.

Code:
```python
def is_woodall(num: int) -> bool:
    n = 0
    while True:
        woodall_number = n * (2 ** n) - 1
        if woodall_number == num:
