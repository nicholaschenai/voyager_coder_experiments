"""
Write a function to locate the left insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. 
assert left_insertion([1,2,4,5],6)==4
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/736 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the left insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: The left insertion point is the index at which a specified value can be inserted into a sorted list while maintaining the order. For example, if you have the list `[1, 2, 4, 5]` and you want to insert `6`, the left insertion point would be `4`, since `6` would be placed after the last element.

2. **Iterate Through the List**: You can iterate through the list and compare each element with the specified value. You need to find the first index where the element is greater than or equal to the specified value.

3. **Return the Index**: Once you find such an index, you can return it as the left insertion point.

4. **Consider Edge Cases**: Make sure to handle cases where the specified value is less than all elements in the list (should return `0`) or greater than all elements (should return the length of the list).

5. **Use Binary Search for Efficiency**: Since the list is sorted, you can implement a binary search algorithm to find the left insertion point more efficiently than a linear search.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic in Python:

```python
def left_insertion(arr, value):
    low, high = 0, len(arr)
    
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] < value:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
            
    return low

# Example usage
assert left_insertion([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4
```

In this implementation:
- We use a binary search approach to find the left insertion point.
- The `low` variable keeps track of the lower bound of the search, and `high` keeps track of the upper bound.
- The loop continues until `low` is no longer less than `high`, at which point `low` will be the index where the value can be inserted. 

This method is efficient with a time complexity of O(log n).

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the left insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: The left insertion point is the index at which a specified value can be inserted into a sorted list while maintaining the order. For example, if you have the list `[1, 2, 4, 5]` and you want to insert `6`, the left insertion point would be `4`, since `6` would be placed after the last element.

2. **Iterate Through the List**: You can iterate through the list and compare each element with the specified value. You need to find the first index where the element is greater than or equal to the specified value.

3. **Return the Index**: Once you find such an index, you can return it as the left insertion point.

4. **Consider Edge Cases**: Make sure to handle cases where the specified value is less than all elements in the list (should return `0`) or greater than all elements (should return the length of the list).

5. **Use Binary Search for Efficiency**: Since the list is sorted, you can implement a binary search algorithm to find the left insertion point more efficiently than a linear search.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic in Python:

```python
def left_insertion(arr, value):
    low, high = 0, len(arr)
    
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] < value:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
            
    return low

# Example usage
assert left_insertion([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4
```

In this implementation:
- We use a binary search approach to find the left insertion point.
- The `low` variable keeps track of the lower bound of the search, and `high` keeps track of the upper bound.
- The loop continues until `low` is no longer less than `high`, at which point `low` will be the index where the value can be inserted. 

This method is efficient with a time complexity of O(log n).

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/736 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct and outlines the steps needed to find the left insertion point in a sorted list. The implementation also correctly uses a binary search approach, which is efficient for this task. The function name and logic align with the requirements specified in the task.

Plan:
1) Define the function `left_insertion` that takes a sorted list and a value as parameters.
2) Initialize two pointers, `low` and `high`, to represent the bounds of the search.
3) Use a while loop to perform binary search until `low` is no longer less than `high`.
4) In each iteration, calculate the midpoint and compare the value at that index with the specified value.
5) If the value at the midpoint is less than the specified value, move the `low` pointer up; otherwise, move the `high` pointer down.
6) Once the loop ends, return the `low` pointer, which will be the left insertion point.

Code:
```python
def left_insertion(arr, value):
    low, high = 0, len(arr)
    
    while low < high:
