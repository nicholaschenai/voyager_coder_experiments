"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/726 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of writing a function that takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function that accepts a tuple as an argument.

2. **Initialize an Empty List**: Create an empty list to store the results of the products.

3. **Iterate Through the Tuple**: Use a loop to iterate through the indices of the input tuple, stopping one element before the last index. This is because you will be multiplying the current element with the next one.

4. **Calculate the Product**: For each index, calculate the product of the current element and the next element.

5. **Store the Result**: Append the calculated product to the results list.

6. **Convert to Tuple**: After the loop, convert the results list to a tuple before returning it.

7. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the resulting tuple.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def multiply_elements(t):
    result = []  # Step 2: Initialize an empty list
    for i in range(len(t) - 1):  # Step 3: Iterate through the tuple
        product = t[i] * t[i + 1]  # Step 4: Calculate the product
        result.append(product)  # Step 5: Store the result
    return tuple(result)  # Step 6: Convert to tuple and return
```

This function will take a tuple of numbers as input and return a new tuple containing the products of consecutive elements, as demonstrated in the provided assertion.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of writing a function that takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function that accepts a tuple as an argument.

2. **Initialize an Empty List**: Create an empty list to store the results of the products.

3. **Iterate Through the Tuple**: Use a loop to iterate through the indices of the input tuple, stopping one element before the last index. This is because you will be multiplying the current element with the next one.

4. **Calculate the Product**: For each index, calculate the product of the current element and the next element.

5. **Store the Result**: Append the calculated product to the results list.

6. **Convert to Tuple**: After the loop, convert the results list to a tuple before returning it.

7. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the resulting tuple.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def multiply_elements(t):
    result = []  # Step 2: Initialize an empty list
    for i in range(len(t) - 1):  # Step 3: Iterate through the tuple
        product = t[i] * t[i + 1]  # Step 4: Calculate the product
        result.append(product)  # Step 5: Store the result
    return tuple(result)  # Step 6: Convert to tuple and return
```

This function will take a tuple of numbers as input and return a new tuple containing the products of consecutive elements, as demonstrated in the provided assertion.
