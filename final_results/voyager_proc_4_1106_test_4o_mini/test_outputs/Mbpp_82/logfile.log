"""
Write a function to find the volume of a sphere.
assert math.isclose(volume_sphere(10), 4188.790204786391, rel_tol=0.001)
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/82 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of writing a function to find the volume of a sphere in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand the Formula**: The volume \( V \) of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
   \]
   where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere.

2. **Import Required Module**: Since the formula involves Ï€ (pi), you will need to import the `math` module, which provides a constant for Ï€.

3. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `volume_sphere` that takes one parameter (the radius).

4. **Calculate the Volume**: Inside the function, use the formula to calculate the volume based on the provided radius.

5. **Return the Result**: The function should return the calculated volume.

6. **Testing the Function**: Use the `assert` statement to test the function with a specific radius (in this case, 10) and check if the result is close to the expected volume using `math.isclose` for floating-point comparison.

Here is a conceptual outline of the code:

```python
import math

def volume_sphere(radius):
    # Calculate the volume using the formula
    volume = (4/3) * math.pi * (radius ** 3)
    return volume

# Test the function
assert math.isclose(volume_sphere(10), 4188.790204786391, rel_tol=0.001)
```

This code defines the function and tests it to ensure it works correctly.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/82 [generation text] Explain: The plan provided is mostly correct and covers the necessary steps to implement the function for calculating the volume of a sphere. The only thing to note is that the `math` module needs to be imported to access the constant `pi`. The function should be defined to take a single parameter for the radius and return the calculated volume using the formula.

Plan:
1. Import the `math` module to access the constant `pi`.
2. Define the function `volume_sphere` that takes one parameter, `radius`.
3. Use the formula for the volume of a sphere \( V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \) to calculate the volume.
4. Return the calculated volume.
5. Ensure the function passes the assertion provided in the task.
