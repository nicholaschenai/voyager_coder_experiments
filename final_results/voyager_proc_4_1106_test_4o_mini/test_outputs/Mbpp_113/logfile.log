Write a function to check if a string represents an integer or not.
assert check_integer("python")==False
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/113 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of checking if a string represents an integer in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `check_integer` that takes a single argument (the string to be checked).

2. **Use Exception Handling**: Inside the function, you can use a try-except block to attempt converting the string to an integer using the `int()` function. If the conversion is successful, it means the string represents an integer.

3. **Return Boolean Values**: If the conversion is successful, return `True`. If a `ValueError` is raised during the conversion (indicating that the string does not represent a valid integer), catch the exception and return `False`.

4. **Consider Edge Cases**: You may also want to consider edge cases, such as empty strings or strings with whitespace, and handle them appropriately.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def check_integer(s):
    try:
        int(s)  # Attempt to convert the string to an integer
        return True  # Conversion successful, it's an integer
    except ValueError:
        return False  # Conversion failed, it's not an integer
```

With this function, you can assert that `check_integer("python")` returns `False`, as expected.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
