Write a function to find squares of individual elements in a list.
assert square_nums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])==[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/8 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the squares of individual elements in a list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function named `square_nums` that takes a list as an argument.

2. **Iterate Over the List**: Use a loop (like a `for` loop) to iterate over each element in the input list.

3. **Calculate the Square**: For each element, calculate its square by multiplying the element by itself.

4. **Store the Results**: Create a new list to store the squared values.

5. **Return the New List**: After the loop completes, return the new list containing the squared values.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def square_nums(nums):
    return [x ** 2 for x in nums]
```

In this implementation, a list comprehension is used to create a new list where each element is the square of the corresponding element in the input list. The `assert` statement can then be used to verify that the function works as expected.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
