Write a function to sum all amicable numbers from 1 to a specified number.
assert amicable_numbers_sum(999)==504
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/123 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of summing all amicable numbers from 1 to a specified number in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand Amicable Numbers**: Amicable numbers are two different numbers where the sum of the proper divisors (excluding the number itself) of each number equals the other number. For example, the pair (220, 284) is amicable because the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284, and the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220.

2. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `amicable_numbers_sum` that takes a single argument, the upper limit (specified number).

3. **Find Proper Divisors**: Write a helper function to calculate the sum of proper divisors of a number. This can be done by iterating through all numbers less than the given number and checking if they are divisors.

4. **Check for Amicable Pairs**: Loop through all numbers from 1 to the specified number. For each number, calculate its sum of proper divisors. If the sum is different from the number itself and the sum of the proper divisors of that sum equals the original number, then you have found an amicable pair.

5. **Avoid Duplicates**: To avoid counting the same amicable pair twice, you can maintain a set of amicable numbers that you have already added to the sum.

6. **Return the Sum**: Finally, return the sum of all unique amicable numbers found within the specified range.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def sum_of_proper_divisors(n):
    # Calculate the sum of proper divisors of n
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            total += i
    return total

def amicable_numbers_sum(limit):
    amicable_numbers = set()
    for num in range(1, limit + 1):
        partner = sum_of_proper_divisors(num)
        if partner != num and partner <= limit:
            if sum_of_proper_divisors(partner) == num:
                amicable_numbers.add(num)
                amicable_numbers.add(partner)
    return sum(amicable_numbers)

# Example usage
assert amicable_numbers_sum(999) == 504
```

This code structure provides a clear approach to finding and summing amicable numbers up to a specified limit.

At each round of conversation, I will give you

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of summing all amicable numbers from 1 to a specified number in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand Amicable Numbers**: Amicable numbers are two different numbers where the sum of the proper divisors (excluding the number itself) of each number equals the other number. For example, the pair (220, 284) is amicable because the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284, and the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220.

2. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `amicable_numbers_sum` that takes a single argument, the upper limit (specified number).

3. **Find Proper Divisors**: Write a helper function to calculate the sum of proper divisors of a number. This can be done by iterating through all numbers less than the given number and checking if they are divisors.

4. **Check for Amicable Pairs**: Loop through all numbers from 1 to the specified number. For each number, calculate its sum of proper divisors. If the sum is different from the number itself and the sum of the proper divisors of that sum equals the original number, then you have found an amicable pair.

5. **Avoid Duplicates**: To avoid counting the same amicable pair twice, you can maintain a set of amicable numbers that you have already added to the sum.

6. **Return the Sum**: Finally, return the sum of all unique amicable numbers found within the specified range.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def sum_of_proper_divisors(n):
    # Calculate the sum of proper divisors of n
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            total += i
    return total

def amicable_numbers_sum(limit):
    amicable_numbers = set()
    for num in range(1, limit + 1):
        partner = sum_of_proper_divisors(num)
        if partner != num and partner <= limit:
            if sum_of_proper_divisors(partner) == num:
                amicable_numbers.add(num)
                amicable_numbers.add(partner)
    return sum(amicable_numbers)

# Example usage
assert amicable_numbers_sum(999) == 504
```

This code structure provides a clear approach to finding and summing amicable numbers up to a specified limit.
