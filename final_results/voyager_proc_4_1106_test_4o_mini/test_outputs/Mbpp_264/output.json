    "reasoning": "The implementation failed the test case because the calculation for ages greater than 2 is incorrect. The formula used in the implementation adds 3 for each year beyond 2, instead of the correct value of 5. This leads to an incorrect output for the dog's age in dog years.",
    "success": false,
    "critique": "To fix the implementation, you should change the multiplication factor from 3 to 5 in the calculation for ages greater than 2. The corrected line should be: return (24 + ((human_years - 2) * 5)). This will ensure that the function correctly calculates the dog's age in dog years."
