"""
Write a function to convert degrees to radians.
assert radian_degree(90)==1.5707963267948966
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/606 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of converting degrees to radians in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand the Conversion Formula**: The relationship between degrees and radians is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \left(\frac{\pi}{180}\right)
   \]
   Here, \(\pi\) (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159.

2. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `radian_degree` that takes a single argument (the angle in degrees).

3. **Import the Math Module**: To use the value of \(\pi\), you can import the `math` module, which provides a constant `math.pi`.

4. **Implement the Conversion**: Inside the function, apply the conversion formula to convert the input degrees to radians.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the calculated radians from the function.

6. **Testing the Function**: Use an assertion to test the function with the provided example, ensuring that the output matches the expected value.

Here is a conceptual outline of the code:

```python
import math

def radian_degree(degrees):
    # Convert degrees to radians
    radians = degrees * (math.pi / 180)
    return radians

# Test the function
assert radian_degree(90) == 1.5707963267948966
```

This code defines the function and checks that it correctly converts 90 degrees to radians.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of converting degrees to radians in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand the Conversion Formula**: The relationship between degrees and radians is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \left(\frac{\pi}{180}\right)
   \]
   Here, \(\pi\) (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159.

2. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `radian_degree` that takes a single argument (the angle in degrees).

3. **Import the Math Module**: To use the value of \(\pi\), you can import the `math` module, which provides a constant `math.pi`.

4. **Implement the Conversion**: Inside the function, apply the conversion formula to convert the input degrees to radians.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the calculated radians from the function.

6. **Testing the Function**: Use an assertion to test the function with the provided example, ensuring that the output matches the expected value.

Here is a conceptual outline of the code:

```python
import math

def radian_degree(degrees):
    # Convert degrees to radians
    radians = degrees * (math.pi / 180)
    return radians

# Test the function
assert radian_degree(90) == 1.5707963267948966
```

This code defines the function and checks that it correctly converts 90 degrees to radians.
