INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/474 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to replace characters in a string.
assert replace_char("polygon",'y','l')==("pollgon")
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/474 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of replacing characters in a string in Python, you can define a function called `replace_char` that takes three parameters: the original string, the character to be replaced, and the character to replace it with. 

Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of how you can implement this:

1. **Function Definition**: Start by defining the function with the appropriate parameters.

2. **String Iteration**: Use a loop to iterate through each character in the string.

3. **Character Replacement**: For each character, check if it matches the character to be replaced. If it does, append the new character to a result list; if it doesn't, append the original character.

4. **Result Construction**: After the loop, join the list of characters back into a single string.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the newly constructed string.

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of the above logic:

```python
def replace_char(original, to_replace, replacement):
    result = []
    for char in original:
        if char == to_replace:
            result.append(replacement)
        else:
            result.append(char)
    return ''.join(result)

# Example usage
assert replace_char("polygon", 'y', 'l') == "pollgon"
```

This function will replace all occurrences of the specified character in the string with the new character and return the modified string.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

Answer: To accomplish the task of replacing characters in a string in Python, you can define a function called `replace_char` that takes three parameters: the original string, the character to be replaced, and the character to replace it with.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/474 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided in the context is correct and outlines the necessary steps to implement the `replace_char` function. The implementation correctly defines the function, iterates through the string, replaces the specified character, and constructs the final string. The assertion provided in the task will pass with this implementation.

Plan:
1) Define the function `replace_char` with three parameters: `original`, `to_replace`, and `replacement`.
2) Initialize an empty list `result` to store the characters of the new string.
3) Iterate through each character in the `original` string.
4) For each character, check if it matches `to_replace`. If it does, append `replacement` to `result`; otherwise, append the original character.
5) After the loop, join the characters in `result` into a single string and return it.

Code:
```python
def replace_char(original: str, to_replace: str, replacement: str) -> str:
    result = []
    for char in original:
        if char == to_replace:
            result.append(replacement)
