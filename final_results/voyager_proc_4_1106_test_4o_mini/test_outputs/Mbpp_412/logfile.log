INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/412 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a python function to remove odd numbers from a given list.
assert remove_odd([1,2,3]) == [2]
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/412 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of removing odd numbers from a given list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function named `remove_odd` that takes a list as an argument.

2. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop or a list comprehension to iterate through each element in the provided list.

3. **Check for Even Numbers**: For each element, check if it is even. In Python, you can determine if a number is even by using the modulus operator (`%`). Specifically, a number `n` is even if `n % 2 == 0`.

4. **Collect Even Numbers**: Create a new list that contains only the even numbers from the original list.

5. **Return the New List**: Finally, return the new list that contains only the even numbers.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def remove_odd(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
```

In this implementation, a list comprehension is used to create a new list that includes only the numbers that are even. The assertion provided in the question can be used to test the function to ensure it behaves as expected.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
