"""
Write a python function takes in an integer n and returns the sum of squares of first n even natural numbers.
assert square_Sum(2) == 20
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/287 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of writing a Python function that calculates the sum of squares of the first `n` even natural numbers, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand Even Natural Numbers**: The first `n` even natural numbers are 2, 4, 6, ..., up to `2n`. Each of these numbers can be represented as `2 * i` where `i` ranges from 1 to `n`.

2. **Calculate the Square**: For each even number, you need to calculate its square. The square of the `i`-th even number (which is `2 * i`) is `(2 * i) ** 2`.

3. **Sum the Squares**: You will need to accumulate the squares of these even numbers. This can be done using a loop or a comprehension that iterates from 1 to `n`, calculates the square for each even number, and adds them together.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, the function should return the accumulated sum.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def square_Sum(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        even_number = 2 * i
        total += even_number ** 2
    return total
```

In this function:
- We initialize a variable `total` to 0.
- We loop from 1 to `n`, calculate each even number, square it, and add it to `total`.
- After the loop, we return the `total`, which will be the sum of squares of the first `n` even natural numbers.

The assertion `assert square_Sum(2) == 20` checks that the function works correctly for the input `2`, as the first two even natural numbers are 2 and 4, and their squares are 4 and 16, respectively, summing to 20.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

Answer: To accomplish the task of writing a Python function that calculates the sum of squares of the first `n` even natural numbers, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand Even Natural Numbers**: The first `n` even natural numbers are 2, 4, 6, ..., up to `2n`. Each of these numbers can be represented as `2 * i` where `i` ranges from 1 to `n`.

2. **Calculate the Square**: For each even number, you need to calculate its square. The square of the `i`-th even number (which is `2 * i`) is `(2 * i) ** 2`.

- We initialize a variable `total` to 0.
- We loop from 1 to `n`, calculate each even number, square it, and add it to `total`.

The assertion `assert square_Sum(2) == 20` checks that the function works correctly for the input `2`, as the first two even natural numbers are 2 and 4, and their squares are 4 and 16, respectively, summing to 20.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/287 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct and outlines the necessary steps to compute the sum of squares of the first `n` even natural numbers. The function should iterate through the first `n` integers, calculate the corresponding even number, square it, and accumulate the total. The assertion provided will verify that the function works as intended.

Plan:
1) Define the function `square_Sum` that takes an integer `n` as input.
2) Initialize a variable `total` to 0 to hold the sum of squares.
3) Use a loop to iterate from 1 to `n`.
4) For each iteration, calculate the even number as `2 * i`, square it, and add it to `total`.
5) After the loop, return the accumulated `total`.

Code:
```python
def square_Sum(n: int) -> int:
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        even_number = 2 * i
        total += even_number ** 2
