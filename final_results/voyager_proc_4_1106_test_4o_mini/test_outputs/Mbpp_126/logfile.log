Write a python function to find the sum of common divisors of two given numbers.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/126 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the sum of common divisors of two given numbers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function that takes two parameters (the two numbers).

2. **Find Divisors**: For each number, find its divisors. A divisor of a number is any integer that divides the number without leaving a remainder. You can do this by iterating through all integers from 1 to the smaller of the two numbers and checking if they divide both numbers evenly.

3. **Identify Common Divisors**: As you find the divisors of both numbers, check which divisors are common to both sets of divisors.

4. **Sum the Common Divisors**: Once you have the common divisors, calculate their sum.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the sum of the common divisors.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def sum_common_divisors(a, b):
    # Step 1: Find the smaller of the two numbers
    smaller = min(a, b)
    
    # Step 2: Initialize a list to hold common divisors
    common_divisors = []
    
    # Step 3: Loop through all numbers from 1 to smaller
    for i in range(1, smaller + 1):
        # Step 4: Check if i is a divisor of both a and b
        if a % i == 0 and b % i == 0:
            common_divisors.append(i)
    
    # Step 5: Return the sum of common divisors
    return sum(common_divisors)

# Example usage
assert sum_common_divisors(10, 15) == 6  # Common divisors are 1 and 5
```

In this example, the common divisors of 10 and 15 are 1 and 5, which sum to 6, thus satisfying the assertion.

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the sum of common divisors of two given numbers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function that takes two parameters (the two numbers).

2. **Find Divisors**: For each number, find its divisors. A divisor of a number is any integer that divides the number without leaving a remainder. You can do this by iterating through all integers from 1 to the smaller of the two numbers and checking if they divide both numbers evenly.

3. **Identify Common Divisors**: As you find the divisors of both numbers, check which divisors are common to both sets of divisors.

4. **Sum the Common Divisors**: Once you have the common divisors, calculate their sum.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the sum of the common divisors.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def sum_common_divisors(a, b):
    # Step 1: Find the smaller of the two numbers
    smaller = min(a, b)
    
    # Step 2: Initialize a list to hold common divisors
    common_divisors = []
    
    # Step 3: Loop through all numbers from 1 to smaller
    for i in range(1, smaller + 1):
        # Step 4: Check if i is a divisor of both a and b
        if a % i == 0 and b % i == 0:
            common_divisors.append(i)
    
    # Step 5: Return the sum of common divisors
    return sum(common_divisors)

# Example usage
assert sum_common_divisors(10, 15) == 6  # Common divisors are 1 and 5
```

In this example, the common divisors of 10 and 15 are 1 and 5, which sum to 6, thus satisfying the assertion.

It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

Write a python function to find the sum of common divisors of two given numbers.
assert sum(10,15) == 6
"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the sum of common divisors of two given numbers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function that takes two parameters (the two numbers).

2. **Find Divisors**: For each number, find its divisors. A divisor of a number is any integer that divides the number without leaving a remainder. You can do this by iterating through all integers from 1 to the smaller of the two numbers and checking if they divide both numbers evenly.

3. **Identify Common Divisors**: As you find the divisors of both numbers, check which divisors are common to both sets of divisors.

4. **Sum the Common Divisors**: Once you have the common divisors, calculate their sum.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the sum of the common divisors.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def sum_common_divisors(a, b):
    # Step 1: Find the smaller of the two numbers
    smaller = min(a, b)
    
    # Step 2: Initialize a list to hold common divisors
    common_divisors = []
    
    # Step 3: Loop through all numbers from 1 to smaller
    for i in range(1, smaller + 1):
        # Step 4: Check if i is a divisor of both a and b
        if a % i == 0 and b % i == 0:
            common_divisors.append(i)
    
    # Step 5: Return the sum of common divisors
    return sum(common_divisors)

# Example usage
assert sum_common_divisors(10, 15) == 6  # Common divisors are 1 and 5
```

In this example, the common divisors of 10 and 15 are 1 and 5, which sum to 6, thus satisfying the assertion.


[Critique]
To resolve this issue, you should rename your function to something other than `sum`, such as `sum_common_divisors`. This will prevent the naming conflict with the built-in `sum` function and allow your implementation to work correctly.


INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/126 [generation text] Explain: The code provided in the last round defines a function named `sum`, which conflicts with Python's built-in `sum` function. This causes an error when trying to call `sum` within the function, as it leads to a recursive call instead of summing the common divisors. To resolve this, I need to rename the function to something unique, such as `sum_common_divisors`, and ensure that I correctly calculate the sum of the common divisors.

Plan:
1) Define a new function named `sum_common_divisors` that takes two integers as parameters.
2) Find the smaller of the two numbers to limit the range for finding divisors.
3) Initialize a list to store the common divisors of the two numbers.
4) Loop through all integers from 1 to the smaller number and check if each integer is a divisor of both numbers.
5) If an integer is a common divisor, add it to the list of common divisors.
6) Calculate the sum of the common divisors using the built-in `sum` function.
7) Return the calculated sum.

Code:
```python
def sum_common_divisors(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    smaller = min(a, b)
    common_divisors = []
    for i in range(1, smaller + 1):
        if (a % i == 0) and (b % i == 0):
            common_divisors.append(i)
    return sum(common_divisors)
```
