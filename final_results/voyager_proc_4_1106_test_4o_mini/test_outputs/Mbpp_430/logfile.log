"""
Write a function to find the directrix of a parabola.
assert parabola_directrix(5,3,2)==-198
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/430 [generation text] Answer: To find the directrix of a parabola given its standard form, we need to understand the parameters involved. A parabola can be represented in the form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) or in vertex form \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \), where \((h, k)\) is the vertex of the parabola.

The directrix of a parabola is a line that is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry and is located at a distance from the vertex that is equal to the distance from the vertex to the focus. For a parabola that opens upwards or downwards, the directrix can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Directrix} = k - \frac{1}{4p} \]

where \( p \) is the distance from the vertex to the focus. The value of \( p \) can be derived from the coefficient \( a \) in the parabola's equation, specifically:

\[ p = \frac{1}{4a} \]

Given the parameters of the function `parabola_directrix(a, b, c)`, you can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the vertex \((h, k)\) of the parabola using the formulas:
   - \( h = -\frac{b}{2a} \)
   - \( k = f(h) \) where \( f(x) \) is the parabola's equation.

2. Determine the value of \( p \) using \( a \).

3. Calculate the directrix using the formula mentioned above.

4. Return the value of the directrix.

Here is a conceptual implementation of the function:

```python
def parabola_directrix(a, b, c):
    # Step 1: Calculate the vertex (h, k)
    h = -b / (2 * a)
    k = a * h**2 + b * h + c  # f(h)

    # Step 2: Calculate p
    p = 1 / (4 * a)

    # Step 3: Calculate the directrix
    directrix = k - p

    return directrix
```

In this case, you would need to ensure that the function returns the expected value of -198 when called with the parameters (5, 3, 2). You may need to adjust the calculations based on the specific form of the parabola you are working with.

Write a function to find the directrix of a parabola.

"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To find the directrix of a parabola given its standard form, we need to understand the parameters involved. A parabola can be represented in the form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) or in vertex form \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \), where \((h, k)\) is the vertex of the parabola.

The directrix of a parabola is a line that is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry and is located at a distance from the vertex that is equal to the distance from the vertex to the focus. For a parabola that opens upwards or downwards, the directrix can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Directrix} = k - \frac{1}{4p} \]

where \( p \) is the distance from the vertex to the focus. The value of \( p \) can be derived from the coefficient \( a \) in the parabola's equation, specifically:

\[ p = \frac{1}{4a} \]

Given the parameters of the function `parabola_directrix(a, b, c)`, you can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the vertex \((h, k)\) of the parabola using the formulas:
   - \( h = -\frac{b}{2a} \)
   - \( k = f(h) \) where \( f(x) \) is the parabola's equation.

2. Determine the value of \( p \) using \( a \).

3. Calculate the directrix using the formula mentioned above.

4. Return the value of the directrix.

Here is a conceptual implementation of the function:

```python
def parabola_directrix(a, b, c):
    # Step 1: Calculate the vertex (h, k)
    h = -b / (2 * a)
    k = a * h**2 + b * h + c  # f(h)

    # Step 2: Calculate p
    p = 1 / (4 * a)

    # Step 3: Calculate the directrix
    directrix = k - p

    return directrix
```

In this case, you would need to ensure that the function returns the expected value of -198 when called with the parameters (5, 3, 2). You may need to adjust the calculations based on the specific form of the parabola you are working with.

    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

"""
Write a function to find the directrix of a parabola.
assert parabola_directrix(5,3,2)==-198
"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To find the directrix of a parabola given its standard form, we need to understand the parameters involved. A parabola can be represented in the form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) or in vertex form \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \), where \((h, k)\) is the vertex of the parabola.

The directrix of a parabola is a line that is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry and is located at a distance from the vertex that is equal to the distance from the vertex to the focus. For a parabola that opens upwards or downwards, the directrix can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Directrix} = k - \frac{1}{4p} \]

where \( p \) is the distance from the vertex to the focus. The value of \( p \) can be derived from the coefficient \( a \) in the parabola's equation, specifically:

\[ p = \frac{1}{4a} \]

Given the parameters of the function `parabola_directrix(a, b, c)`, you can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the vertex \((h, k)\) of the parabola using the formulas:
   - \( h = -\frac{b}{2a} \)
   - \( k = f(h) \) where \( f(x) \) is the parabola's equation.

2. Determine the value of \( p \) using \( a \).

3. Calculate the directrix using the formula mentioned above.

4. Return the value of the directrix.

Here is a conceptual implementation of the function:

```python
def parabola_directrix(a, b, c):
    # Step 1: Calculate the vertex (h, k)
    h = -b / (2 * a)
    k = a * h**2 + b * h + c  # f(h)

    # Step 2: Calculate p
    p = 1 / (4 * a)

    # Step 3: Calculate the directrix
    directrix = k - p

    return directrix
```

In this case, you would need to ensure that the function returns the expected value of -198 when called with the parameters (5, 3, 2). You may need to adjust the calculations based on the specific form of the parabola you are working with.


[Critique]
To fix the implementation, ensure that the vertex k is calculated correctly. The formula for k should be based on the vertex coordinates, which is k = a * h^2 + b * h + c. Additionally, ensure that the directrix is calculated as k - p, where p = 1/(4a). After correcting these calculations, the function should return the expected value.


INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/430 [generation text] Explain: The previous implementation of the `parabola_directrix` function has a mistake in calculating the vertex \( k \). The formula used for \( k \) was incorrect. The correct formula for \( k \) should be based on the vertex coordinates, which is \( k = a \cdot h^2 + b \cdot h + c \). Additionally, the directrix should be calculated as \( k - p \), where \( p = \frac{1}{4a} \).

1. Calculate the vertex \( h \) using the formula \( h = -\frac{b}{2a} \).
2. Calculate \( k \) using the correct formula \( k = a \cdot h^2 + b \cdot h + c \).
3. Calculate \( p \) using the formula \( p = \frac{1}{4a} \).
4. Calculate the directrix using the formula \( \text{Directrix} = k - p \).
5. Return the directrix as an integer.

Code:

It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

"""
Write a function to find the directrix of a parabola.
assert parabola_directrix(5,3,2)==-198
"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To find the directrix of a parabola given its standard form, we need to understand the parameters involved. A parabola can be represented in the form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) or in vertex form \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \), where \((h, k)\) is the vertex of the parabola.

The directrix of a parabola is a line that is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry and is located at a distance from the vertex that is equal to the distance from the vertex to the focus. For a parabola that opens upwards or downwards, the directrix can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Directrix} = k - \frac{1}{4p} \]

where \( p \) is the distance from the vertex to the focus. The value of \( p \) can be derived from the coefficient \( a \) in the parabola's equation, specifically:

\[ p = \frac{1}{4a} \]

Given the parameters of the function `parabola_directrix(a, b, c)`, you can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the vertex \((h, k)\) of the parabola using the formulas:
   - \( h = -\frac{b}{2a} \)
   - \( k = f(h) \) where \( f(x) \) is the parabola's equation.

2. Determine the value of \( p \) using \( a \).

3. Calculate the directrix using the formula mentioned above.

4. Return the value of the directrix.

Here is a conceptual implementation of the function:

```python
def parabola_directrix(a, b, c):
    # Step 1: Calculate the vertex (h, k)
    h = -b / (2 * a)
    k = a * h**2 + b * h + c  # f(h)

    # Step 2: Calculate p
    p = 1 / (4 * a)

    # Step 3: Calculate the directrix
    directrix = k - p

    return directrix
```

In this case, you would need to ensure that the function returns the expected value of -198 when called with the parameters (5, 3, 2). You may need to adjust the calculations based on the specific form of the parabola you are working with.


[Critique]
To fix the implementation, ensure that the vertex k is calculated correctly. The formula for k should be based on the vertex coordinates, which is k = a * h^2 + b * h + c. Additionally, ensure that the directrix is calculated as k - p, where p = 1/(4a). After correcting these calculations, the function should return the expected value.


INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/430 [generation text] Explain: The previous implementation of the `parabola_directrix` function has a mistake in calculating the vertex \( k \). The formula used for \( k \) was incorrect. The correct formula for \( k \) should be based on the vertex coordinates, which is \( k = a \cdot h^2 + b \cdot h + c \). Additionally, the directrix should be calculated as \( k - p \), where \( p = \frac{1}{4a} \).

1. Calculate the vertex \( h \) using the formula \( h = -\frac{b}{2a} \).
2. Calculate \( k \) using the correct formula \( k = a \cdot h^2 + b \cdot h + c \).
3. Calculate \( p \) using the formula \( p = \frac{1}{4a} \).
4. Calculate the directrix using the formula \( \text{Directrix} = k - p \).
5. Return the directrix as an integer.

Write a function to find the directrix of a parabola.
assert parabola_directrix(5,3,2)==-198
"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To find the directrix of a parabola given its standard form, we need to understand the parameters involved. A parabola can be represented in the form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) or in vertex form \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \), where \((h, k)\) is the vertex of the parabola.

The directrix of a parabola is a line that is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry and is located at a distance from the vertex that is equal to the distance from the vertex to the focus. For a parabola that opens upwards or downwards, the directrix can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Directrix} = k - \frac{1}{4p} \]

where \( p \) is the distance from the vertex to the focus. The value of \( p \) can be derived from the coefficient \( a \) in the parabola's equation, specifically:

\[ p = \frac{1}{4a} \]

Given the parameters of the function `parabola_directrix(a, b, c)`, you can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the vertex \((h, k)\) of the parabola using the formulas:
   - \( h = -\frac{b}{2a} \)
   - \( k = f(h) \) where \( f(x) \) is the parabola's equation.

2. Determine the value of \( p \) using \( a \).

3. Calculate the directrix using the formula mentioned above.

4. Return the value of the directrix.

Here is a conceptual implementation of the function:

```python
def parabola_directrix(a, b, c):
    # Step 1: Calculate the vertex (h, k)
    h = -b / (2 * a)
    k = a * h**2 + b * h + c  # f(h)

    # Step 2: Calculate p
    p = 1 / (4 * a)

    # Step 3: Calculate the directrix
    directrix = k - p

    return directrix
```

In this case, you would need to ensure that the function returns the expected value of -198 when called with the parameters (5, 3, 2). You may need to adjust the calculations based on the specific form of the parabola you are working with.


[Critique]
To fix the implementation, ensure that the vertex k is calculated correctly. The formula for k should be based on the vertex coordinates, which is k = a * h^2 + b * h + c. Additionally, ensure that the directrix is calculated as k - p, where p = 1/(4a). After correcting these calculations, the function should return the expected value.


INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/430 [generation text] Explain: The previous implementation of the `parabola_directrix` function has a mistake in calculating the vertex \( k \). The formula used for \( k \) was incorrect. The correct formula for \( k \) should be based on the vertex coordinates, which is \( k = a \cdot h^2 + b \cdot h + c \). Additionally, the directrix should be calculated as \( k - p \), where \( p = \frac{1}{4a} \). 

Plan:
1. Calculate the vertex \( h \) using the formula \( h = -\frac{b}{2a} \).
2. Calculate \( k \) using the correct formula \( k = a \cdot h^2 + b \cdot h + c \).
3. Calculate \( p \) using the formula \( p = \frac{1}{4a} \).
4. Calculate the directrix using the formula \( \text{Directrix} = k - p \).
5. Return the directrix as an integer.

Code:
```python
def parabola_directrix(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:
    # Step 1: Calculate the vertex (h)
    h = -b / (2 * a)
    
    # Step 2: Calculate k using the parabola equation
    k = a * h**2 + b * h + c

    # Step 3: Calculate p

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)
