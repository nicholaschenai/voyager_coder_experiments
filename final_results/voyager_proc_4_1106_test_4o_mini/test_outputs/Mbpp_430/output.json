    "reasoning": "The implementation failed the test case because the calculated directrix does not match the expected value of -198. The formula used to calculate the directrix seems to be incorrect, particularly in how the vertex and the distance to the focus are computed. The directrix should be calculated as k - p, but the value of k is not being computed correctly due to the order of operations and the formula used.",
    "success": false,
    "critique": "To fix the implementation, ensure that the vertex k is calculated correctly. The formula for k should be based on the vertex coordinates, which is k = a * h^2 + b * h + c. Additionally, ensure that the directrix is calculated as k - p, where p = 1/(4a). After correcting these calculations, the function should return the expected value."
