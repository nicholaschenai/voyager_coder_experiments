INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/413 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of extracting the nth element from a list of tuples in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function named `extract_nth_element` that takes two parameters: a list of tuples and an integer `n` representing the index of the element to extract.

2. **Iterate Over the List**: Use a loop (like a list comprehension) to iterate over each tuple in the provided list.

3. **Access the nth Element**: For each tuple, access the element at index `n` and collect these elements into a new list.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the new list containing the extracted elements.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def extract_nth_element(tuples_list, n):
    return [t[n] for t in tuples_list]
```

In this function:
- `tuples_list` is the input list of tuples.
- `n` is the index of the element you want to extract from each tuple.
- The list comprehension `[t[n] for t in tuples_list]` creates a new list by accessing the nth element of each tuple `t`.

This approach is efficient and leverages Python's powerful list comprehension feature to create the desired output in a concise manner.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
