INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/267 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a python function that takes in an integer n and returns the sum of the squares of the first n odd natural numbers.
assert square_Sum(2) == 10
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/267 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of writing a Python function that calculates the sum of the squares of the first `n` odd natural numbers, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand Odd Natural Numbers**: The first `n` odd natural numbers are 1, 3, 5, ..., which can be generated using the formula `2*i - 1` where `i` ranges from 1 to `n`.

2. **Calculate Squares**: For each of these odd numbers, you need to calculate the square. The square of an odd number `x` can be computed as `x * x`.

3. **Sum the Squares**: As you calculate the square of each odd number, you can maintain a running total (sum) of these squares.

4. **Function Definition**: Define a function that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the computed sum.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps in Python:

```python
def square_Sum(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        odd_number = 2 * i - 1  # Generate the i-th odd number
        total += odd_number ** 2  # Add the square of the odd number to the total
    return total
```

In this function:
- We initialize `total` to 0.
- We loop from 1 to `n`, generating each odd number and adding its square to `total`.
- Finally, we return the total sum.

The assertion `assert square_Sum(2) == 10` checks that the function works correctly, as the first two odd natural numbers are 1 and 3, and their squares are 1 and 9, which sum to 10.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/267 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is correct and outlines the necessary steps to compute the sum of the squares of the first `n` odd natural numbers. The implementation in the plan is also accurate and follows the logic described. There are no missing steps, and the function should work as intended.

Plan:
1) Define the function `square_Sum` that takes an integer `n` as input.
2) Initialize a variable `total` to 0 to keep track of the sum of squares.
3) Use a loop to iterate from 1 to `n`, generating the `i`-th odd number using the formula `2 * i - 1`.
4) Calculate the square of the odd number and add it to `total`.
5) Return the final value of `total`.

```python
def square_Sum(n: int) -> int:
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        odd_number = 2 * i - 1  # Generate the i-th odd number
