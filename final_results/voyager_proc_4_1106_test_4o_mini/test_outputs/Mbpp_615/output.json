    "reasoning": "The implementation failed the test case because the averages calculated for the inner tuples are incorrect. The function is summing the elements of each inner tuple and dividing by the number of elements, but it seems to be returning the wrong values for the averages, indicating a potential issue with how the tuples are being processed or how the averages are being calculated.",

    "critique": "The issue in the implementation is likely due to the way the tuples are being passed to the function. The function expects a tuple of tuples, but if the input is not structured correctly, it may not be iterating over the inner tuples as intended. To fix this, ensure that the input to the function is indeed a tuple of tuples. Additionally, verify that the calculation of the average is being done correctly by checking the sum and length of each inner tuple."
