INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/59 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to find the nth octagonal number.
assert is_octagonal(5) == 65
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/59 [generation text] Answer: To find the nth octagonal number in Python, you can use the formula for the nth octagonal number, which is given by:

\[ O(n) = n(3n - 2) \]

This formula derives from the geometric properties of octagons. 

Hereâ€™s how you can accomplish this task conceptually:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `is_octagonal` that takes an integer `n` as an argument.

2. **Implement the Formula**: Inside the function, use the formula \( O(n) = n(3n - 2) \) to calculate the nth octagonal number.

3. **Return the Result**: The function should return the calculated octagonal number.

4. **Testing the Function**: Use an assertion to test the function with the provided example, checking if `is_octagonal(5)` returns `65`.

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of the above steps in Python:

```python
def is_octagonal(n):
    return n * (3 * n - 2)

# Test the function
assert is_octagonal(5) == 65
```

This code defines the function and checks that the fifth octagonal number is indeed 65, as expected.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
