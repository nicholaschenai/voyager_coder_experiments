"""
Write a python function to find the largest number that can be formed with the given list of digits.
assert find_Max_Num([1,2,3]) == 321
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/57 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the largest number that can be formed with a given list of digits in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Convert Digits to Strings**: Since you want to concatenate the digits to form the largest number, it's easier to work with them as strings.

2. **Sort the Digits**: You need to sort the list of string digits in a way that when concatenated, they form the largest possible number. This can be done by defining a custom sorting rule. For two digits `x` and `y`, you should compare the concatenated results of `x+y` and `y+x`. If `x+y` is greater, then `x` should come before `y` in the sorted order.

3. **Join the Sorted Digits**: After sorting the digits based on the custom rule, you can join them together to form the final largest number.

4. **Convert Back to Integer (if needed)**: If you want the result as an integer, you can convert the final string back to an integer.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def find_Max_Num(digits):
    # Step 1: Convert digits to strings
    str_digits = list(map(str, digits))
    
    # Step 2: Sort the digits based on the custom rule
    str_digits.sort(key=lambda x: x*10, reverse=True)  # Multiply to ensure proper comparison
    
    # Step 3: Join the sorted digits
    largest_num_str = ''.join(str_digits)
    
    # Step 4: Convert to integer (optional)
    return int(largest_num_str)
```

This function will return the largest number that can be formed from the list of digits. The use of `x*10` in the sorting key is a trick to ensure that the comparison works correctly for all digit lengths. 

You can then test the function with the provided assertion:

```python
assert find_Max_Num([1, 2, 3]) == 321
```

This approach ensures that you get the correct largest number efficiently.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the largest number that can be formed with a given list of digits in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Convert Digits to Strings**: Since you want to concatenate the digits to form the largest number, it's easier to work with them as strings.

2. **Sort the Digits**: You need to sort the list of string digits in a way that when concatenated, they form the largest possible number. This can be done by defining a custom sorting rule. For two digits `x` and `y`, you should compare the concatenated results of `x+y` and `y+x`. If `x+y` is greater, then `x` should come before `y` in the sorted order.

3. **Join the Sorted Digits**: After sorting the digits based on the custom rule, you can join them together to form the final largest number.

4. **Convert Back to Integer (if needed)**: If you want the result as an integer, you can convert the final string back to an integer.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def find_Max_Num(digits):
    # Step 1: Convert digits to strings
    str_digits = list(map(str, digits))
    
    # Step 2: Sort the digits based on the custom rule
    str_digits.sort(key=lambda x: x*10, reverse=True)  # Multiply to ensure proper comparison
    
    # Step 3: Join the sorted digits
    largest_num_str = ''.join(str_digits)
    
    # Step 4: Convert to integer (optional)
    return int(largest_num_str)
```

This function will return the largest number that can be formed from the list of digits. The use of `x*10` in the sorting key is a trick to ensure that the comparison works correctly for all digit lengths. 

You can then test the function with the provided assertion:

```python
assert find_Max_Num([1, 2, 3]) == 321
```

This approach ensures that you get the correct largest number efficiently.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/57 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct and outlines the necessary steps to achieve the task. However, the sorting key can be simplified without multiplying by 10. Instead, we can directly compare the concatenated strings. The overall logic is sound, and the function can be implemented as described.

Plan:
1) Convert the list of digits to strings to facilitate concatenation.
2) Sort the list of string digits using a custom sorting rule that compares the concatenated results of two digits in both possible orders.
3) Join the sorted list of strings to form the largest number.
4) Convert the final string back to an integer and return it.
