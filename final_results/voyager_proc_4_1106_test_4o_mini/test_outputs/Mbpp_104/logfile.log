INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/104 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of sorting each sublist of strings in a given list of lists in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function that takes a list of lists as an argument.

2. **Iterate Over Sublists**: Use a loop to iterate through each sublist in the main list.

3. **Sort Each Sublist**: For each sublist, use Python's built-in `sorted()` function or the `sort()` method to sort the strings in that sublist.

4. **Return the Result**: After sorting all the sublists, return the modified list of lists.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def sort_sublists(list_of_lists):
    # Iterate through each sublist
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        # Sort the sublist in place
        sublist.sort()  # or use sorted(sublist) to create a new sorted list
    return list_of_lists
```

5. **Testing the Function**: You can use an assertion to test if the function works as expected by comparing the output of the function with the expected sorted list of lists.

By following these steps, you can effectively sort each sublist of strings within a list of lists in Python.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/104 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct, but it lacks the specific implementation details required to meet the task's requirements. The function should be defined to accept a tuple of lists, not just a list of lists. Additionally, the output should also be a list of lists, which is not explicitly mentioned in the plan.

Plan:
1) Define the function `sort_sublists` that takes a tuple of lists as input.
2) Convert the tuple to a list to allow for sorting of each sublist.
3) Iterate over each sublist in the list.
4) Sort each sublist in place using the `sort()` method.
5) Return the modified list of lists.

Code:
```python
def sort_sublists(list_of_lists):
    # Convert the tuple to a list
    list_of_lists = list(list_of_lists)
    # Iterate through each sublist
