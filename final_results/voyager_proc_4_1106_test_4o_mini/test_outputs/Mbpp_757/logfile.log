"""
Write a function to count the pairs of reverse strings in the given string list. 
assert count_reverse_pairs(["julia", "best", "tseb", "for", "ailuj"])== 2
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/757 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of counting pairs of reverse strings in a given list, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function named `count_reverse_pairs` that takes a list of strings as its parameter.

2. **Create a Set for Uniqueness**: Use a set to keep track of the strings you have already processed. This will help avoid counting the same pair multiple times.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Loop through each string in the list. For each string, generate its reverse using slicing (e.g., `string[::-1]`).

4. **Check for Pairs**: For each string, check if its reverse exists in the set of strings. If it does, increment a counter to keep track of the number of reverse pairs found.

5. **Add to the Set**: After checking for pairs, add the original string to the set to ensure that you do not count it again in future iterations.

6. **Return the Count**: Finally, return the count of reverse pairs.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def count_reverse_pairs(string_list):
    seen = set()
    count = 0
    
    for string in string_list:
        reversed_string = string[::-1]
        if reversed_string in seen:
            count += 1
        seen.add(string)
    
    return count
```

In this implementation, the function will correctly count the number of pairs of strings that are reverses of each other. For the provided example, it will return `2` for the input list `["julia", "best", "tseb", "for", "ailuj"]`.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/757 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct and outlines the necessary steps to implement the function. It correctly identifies the need to use a set to track seen strings and to check for reverse pairs. The implementation in the outline is also appropriate for the task.

Plan:
1) Define the function `count_reverse_pairs` that takes a list of strings as input.
2) Initialize a set to keep track of the strings that have been processed.
3) Initialize a counter to count the number of reverse pairs found.
4) Loop through each string in the input list:
   - Generate the reverse of the current string.
   - Check if the reversed string is in the set of seen strings.
   - If it is, increment the counter.
   - Add the current string to the set of seen strings.
5) Return the count of reverse pairs.

Code:
```python
def count_reverse_pairs(string_list):
    seen = set()
    count = 0
    
    for string in string_list:
        reversed_string = string[::-1]
