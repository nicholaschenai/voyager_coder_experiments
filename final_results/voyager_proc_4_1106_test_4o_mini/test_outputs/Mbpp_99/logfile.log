"""
Write a function to convert the given decimal number to its binary equivalent, represented as a string with no leading zeros.
assert decimal_to_binary(8) == '1000'
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/99 [generation text] Answer: To convert a decimal number to its binary equivalent in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand Binary Representation**: Binary is a base-2 numeral system that uses only two symbols: 0 and 1. Each digit represents a power of 2.

2. **Division by 2 Method**: One common method to convert a decimal number to binary is to repeatedly divide the number by 2 and keep track of the remainders. The binary representation is formed by the remainders read in reverse order.

3. **Function Definition**: Define a function named `decimal_to_binary` that takes an integer as an argument.

4. **Handle Edge Cases**: If the input number is 0, you should return '0' since the binary representation of 0 is simply 0.

5. **Loop for Conversion**: Use a loop to divide the number by 2 until the number becomes 0. In each iteration, store the remainder (which will be either 0 or 1) in a list.

6. **Reverse the List**: After the loop, reverse the list of remainders to get the correct binary order.

7. **Join the List into a String**: Convert the list of binary digits into a string without leading zeros.

8. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the resulting binary string.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def decimal_to_binary(n):
    if n == 0:
        return '0'
    
    binary_digits = []
    while n > 0:
        remainder = n % 2
        binary_digits.append(str(remainder))
        n //= 2
    
    # Reverse the list of digits and join to form the binary string
    binary_digits.reverse()
    return ''.join(binary_digits)

# Example usage
assert decimal_to_binary(8) == '1000'
```

This function will convert a given decimal number to its binary equivalent as a string without leading zeros.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/99 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided in the context is mostly correct and outlines the necessary steps to convert a decimal number to its binary equivalent. However, it does not explicitly mention that the function should handle leading zeros, which is important for the output format. The plan also correctly identifies the need to return '0' for an input of 0.

Plan:
1) Define the function `decimal_to_binary` that takes an integer as input.
2) Check if the input number is 0; if so, return '0'.
3) Initialize an empty list to store the binary digits.
4) Use a while loop to repeatedly divide the number by 2, storing the remainder in the list until the number becomes 0.
5) Reverse the list of binary digits to get the correct order.
6) Join the list into a string and return the result.

Code:
```python
def decimal_to_binary(n: int) -> str:
    if n == 0:
        return '0'
