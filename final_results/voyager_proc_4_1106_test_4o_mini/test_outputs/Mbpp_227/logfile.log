INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/227 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to find minimum of three numbers.
assert min_of_three(10,20,0)==0
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/227 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the minimum of three numbers in Python, you can define a function called `min_of_three` that takes three parameters. Inside the function, you can use the built-in `min()` function, which can take multiple arguments and returns the smallest one. 

Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of the steps:

1. **Define the function**: Use the `def` keyword to create a function named `min_of_three` that accepts three parameters (let's call them `a`, `b`, and `c`).

2. **Use the `min()` function**: Inside the function, call the `min()` function with the three parameters as arguments. This will return the smallest of the three numbers.

3. **Return the result**: Use the `return` statement to return the result from the function.

4. **Testing the function**: You can use an assertion to test if the function works correctly by checking if `min_of_three(10, 20, 0)` returns `0`.

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def min_of_three(a, b, c):
    return min(a, b, c)

# Test the function
assert min_of_three(10, 20, 0) == 0
```

This function will correctly find and return the minimum of the three numbers provided.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the minimum of three numbers in Python, you can define a function called `min_of_three` that takes three parameters. Inside the function, you can use the built-in `min()` function, which can take multiple arguments and returns the smallest one. 

Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of the steps:

1. **Define the function**: Use the `def` keyword to create a function named `min_of_three` that accepts three parameters (let's call them `a`, `b`, and `c`).

2. **Use the `min()` function**: Inside the function, call the `min()` function with the three parameters as arguments. This will return the smallest of the three numbers.

3. **Return the result**: Use the `return` statement to return the result from the function.

4. **Testing the function**: You can use an assertion to test if the function works correctly by checking if `min_of_three(10, 20, 0)` returns `0`.

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def min_of_three(a, b, c):
    return min(a, b, c)

# Test the function
assert min_of_three(10, 20, 0) == 0

This function will correctly find and return the minimum of the three numbers provided.
