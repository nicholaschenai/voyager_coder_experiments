INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/728 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of writing a function that takes two lists and returns a new list where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements from the input lists, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function named `sum_list` that takes two parameters, which will be the two input lists.

2. **Initialize an Empty List**: Inside the function, create an empty list that will hold the results of the element-wise sums.

3. **Iterate Over the Lists**: Use a loop to iterate over the indices of the lists. Since both lists are expected to be of the same length, you can use the `range` function to generate indices from 0 to the length of the lists minus one.

4. **Sum Corresponding Elements**: For each index, access the corresponding elements from both lists, sum them, and append the result to the results list.

5. **Return the Result**: After the loop completes, return the results list.

Here is a conceptual outline of the code:

```python
def sum_list(list_a, list_b):
    result = []  # Step 2: Initialize an empty list
    for i in range(len(list_a)):  # Step 3: Iterate over the indices
        result.append(list_a[i] + list_b[i])  # Step 4: Sum and append
    return result  # Step 5: Return the result
```

This function will correctly compute the element-wise sums of the two input lists as specified in the assertion.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/728 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct and outlines the necessary steps to implement the function. However, it does not explicitly handle the case where the input lists might not be of the same length, which could lead to an IndexError. It's important to ensure that both lists are of equal length before proceeding with the summation.

Plan:
1) Define the function `sum_list` that takes two lists as parameters.
2) Check if the lengths of the two lists are equal; if not, raise a ValueError.
3) Initialize an empty list to store the results of the element-wise sums.
4) Use a loop to iterate over the indices of the lists and sum the corresponding elements.
5) Append the sum of each pair of elements to the results list.
