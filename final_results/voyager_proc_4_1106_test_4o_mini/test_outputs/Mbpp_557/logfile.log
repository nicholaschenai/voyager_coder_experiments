"""
Write a function to toggle the case of all characters in a string.
assert toggle_string("Python")==("pYTHON")
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/557 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of toggling the case of all characters in a string in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function named `toggle_string` that takes a single argument, which is the string you want to modify.

2. **Iterate Through Characters**: Use a loop to iterate through each character in the input string. 

3. **Toggle Case**: For each character, check if it is uppercase or lowercase. You can use the string methods `.isupper()` and `.islower()` to determine the case. If the character is uppercase, convert it to lowercase using `.lower()`, and if it is lowercase, convert it to uppercase using `.upper()`.

4. **Build the Result**: As you toggle the case of each character, you can build a new string that contains the modified characters. This can be done using string concatenation or by using a list to collect the characters and then joining them at the end.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the new string that has all characters toggled.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def toggle_string(s):
    toggled = ""
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            toggled += char.lower()
        else:
            toggled += char.upper()
    return toggled

# Example usage
assert toggle_string("Python") == "pYTHON"
```

This function will successfully toggle the case of each character in the input string.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/557 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct and outlines the necessary steps to toggle the case of characters in a string. The implementation also follows the plan and should work as intended. However, I will ensure that the function is defined correctly and adheres to the specified function name and typing.

Plan:
1) Define the function `toggle_string` that takes a single string argument.
2) Initialize an empty string to hold the toggled characters.
3) Iterate through each character in the input string.
4) For each character, check if it is uppercase or lowercase and toggle its case accordingly.
5) Append the toggled character to the result string.
6) Return the final toggled string.

Code:
```python
def toggle_string(s: str) -> str:
    toggled = ""
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            toggled += char.lower()
