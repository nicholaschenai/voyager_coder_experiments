"""
Write a function to find the sum of the largest contiguous sublist in the given list.
assert max_sub_array_sum([-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3], 8) == 7
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/559 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the sum of the largest contiguous sublist in a given list, you can use a well-known algorithm called Kadane's Algorithm. Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of how to implement this:

1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing two variables: one to keep track of the maximum sum found so far (`max_sum`) and another to keep track of the current sum of the contiguous sublist (`current_sum`). You can initialize both to the first element of the list.

2. **Iterate through the list**: Loop through each element of the list starting from the second element. For each element:
   - Update the `current_sum` by adding the current element to it.
   - If `current_sum` exceeds `max_sum`, update `max_sum` to be equal to `current_sum`.
   - If `current_sum` becomes negative, reset it to zero. This is because a negative sum would not contribute positively to any future sublist.

3. **Return the result**: After iterating through the list, `max_sum` will contain the sum of the largest contiguous sublist.

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of the above logic in Python:

```python
def max_sub_array_sum(arr, n):
    max_sum = arr[0]
    current_sum = arr[0]
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        current_sum = max(arr[i], current_sum + arr[i])
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    
    return max_sum

# Example usage
assert max_sub_array_sum([-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3], 8) == 7
```

In this implementation:
- We use `max(arr[i], current_sum + arr[i])` to decide whether to start a new sublist at the current element or to continue the existing sublist.
- The final result is the maximum sum of any contiguous sublist found during the iteration. 

This approach runs in O(n) time complexity, making it efficient for this problem.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
