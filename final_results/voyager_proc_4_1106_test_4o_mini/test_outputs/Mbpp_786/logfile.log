INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/786 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
assert right_insertion([1,2,4,5],6)==4
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/786 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of locating the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: You need to find the index at which a given value can be inserted into a sorted list while maintaining the order. For example, if the list is `[1, 2, 4, 5]` and the value is `6`, the correct insertion point is `4` because `6` would be placed at the end of the list.

2. **Use Binary Search**: Since the list is sorted, you can efficiently find the insertion point using a binary search algorithm. This approach reduces the time complexity to O(log n), which is much faster than a linear search (O(n)).

3. **Implement the Function**:
   - Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the bounds of the search.
   - While `left` is less than or equal to `right`, calculate the middle index.
   - Compare the middle element with the target value:
     - If the middle element is less than or equal to the target, move the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`.
     - If the middle element is greater than the target, move the `right` pointer to `mid - 1`.
   - When the loop ends, `left` will be the index where the target can be inserted.

4. **Return the Result**: The function should return the `left` index, which represents the right insertion point.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic in Python:

```python
def right_insertion(sorted_list, value):
    left, right = 0, len(sorted_list)
    
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if sorted_list[mid] <= value:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid
            
    return left

# Example usage
assert right_insertion([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4
```

This function will correctly find the right insertion point for any specified value in a sorted list.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of locating the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: You need to find the index at which a given value can be inserted into a sorted list while maintaining the order. For example, if the list is `[1, 2, 4, 5]` and the value is `6`, the correct insertion point is `4` because `6` would be placed at the end of the list.

2. **Use Binary Search**: Since the list is sorted, you can efficiently find the insertion point using a binary search algorithm. This approach reduces the time complexity to O(log n), which is much faster than a linear search (O(n)).

3. **Implement the Function**:
   - Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the bounds of the search.
   - While `left` is less than or equal to `right`, calculate the middle index.
   - Compare the middle element with the target value:
     - If the middle element is less than or equal to the target, move the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`.
     - If the middle element is greater than the target, move the `right` pointer to `mid - 1`.
   - When the loop ends, `left` will be the index where the target can be inserted.

4. **Return the Result**: The function should return the `left` index, which represents the right insertion point.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic in Python:

```python
def right_insertion(sorted_list, value):
    left, right = 0, len(sorted_list)
    
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if sorted_list[mid] <= value:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid
            
    return left

# Example usage
assert right_insertion([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4
```

This function will correctly find the right insertion point for any specified value in a sorted list.

The logic is sound, and the implementation adheres to the requirements specified in the task.

Plan:
1) Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the bounds of the search (0 and the length of the list).
