Write a python function to interchange the first and last elements in a list.

"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/591 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of interchanging the first and last elements in a list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `swap_List` that takes a list as an argument.

2. **Check List Length**: Before attempting to swap elements, check if the list has at least two elements. If it has fewer than two elements, swapping is unnecessary.

3. **Swap Elements**: Use indexing to access the first element (index 0) and the last element (index -1) of the list. Assign the last element to the first position and the first element to the last position.

4. **Return the Modified List**: After performing the swap, return the modified list.

5. **Use Assertions for Testing**: Use an assertion to test if the function works as expected by comparing the output of the function with the expected result.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def swap_List(lst):
    if len(lst) < 2:
        return lst  # No swap needed for lists with fewer than 2 elements
    # Swap the first and last elements
    lst[0], lst[-1] = lst[-1], lst[0]
    return lst
```

This function will successfully interchange the first and last elements of the list when called.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/591 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct and outlines the necessary steps to accomplish the task of swapping the first and last elements in a list. The function name and the logic for checking the list length and performing the swap are appropriate. However, the plan does not explicitly mention returning the modified list, which is crucial for the function to work as intended.

Plan:
1) Define the function `swap_List` that takes a list as an argument.
2) Check if the list has at least two elements; if not, return the list as is.
3) Swap the first element (index 0) with the last element (index -1) using tuple unpacking.
4) Return the modified list.

Code:
```python
def swap_List(lst):
    if len(lst) < 2:
        return lst  # No swap needed for lists with fewer than 2 elements
    # Swap the first and last elements
    lst[0], lst[-1] = lst[-1], lst[0]
