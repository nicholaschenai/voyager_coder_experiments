INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/600 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a python function to check whether the given number is even or not.
assert is_Even(1) == False
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/600 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of checking whether a given number is even or not in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `is_Even` that takes a single argument (the number you want to check).

2. **Check Evenness**: Inside the function, use the modulus operator `%` to determine if the number is even. A number is considered even if it is divisible by 2 without a remainder. This can be checked using the expression `number % 2 == 0`.

3. **Return the Result**: The function should return `True` if the number is even and `False` if it is not.

4. **Use Assertions for Testing**: You can use an assertion to test the function. The assertion `assert is_Even(1) == False` checks that the function correctly identifies that 1 is not an even number.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps in Python:

```python
def is_Even(number):
    return number % 2 == 0

# Testing the function
assert is_Even(1) == False
```

This code defines the function and includes a test case to verify its correctness.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

However, it does not explicitly mention the function signature and typing that should be followed according to the assertion. The function should accept an integer and return a boolean.

Plan:
1) Define the function `is_Even` that takes an integer as an argument.
2) Use the modulus operator `%` to check if the number is even by evaluating `number % 2 == 0`.
3) Return `True` if the number is even, otherwise return `False`.
