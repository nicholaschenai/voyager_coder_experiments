"""
Write a function to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string.
assert find_length("11000010001") == 6
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/125 [generation text] Answer: To solve the problem of finding the maximum difference between the number of 0s and 1s in any substring of a given binary string, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Transform the String**: Convert the binary string into a numerical representation where '0' is treated as +1 and '1' as -1. This transformation allows you to reframe the problem as finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.

2. **Use a Prefix Sum Approach**: As you iterate through the transformed array, maintain a running sum. The idea is to keep track of the maximum sum encountered so far and the minimum sum to calculate the maximum difference.

3. **Kadane's Algorithm**: Implement a variation of Kadane's algorithm, which is typically used to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray. In this case, you will be looking for the maximum value of the running sum minus the minimum value of the running sum at any point.

4. **Return the Result**: The result will be the maximum sum found, which corresponds to the maximum difference between the number of 0s and 1s in any substring.

Here is a high-level outline of the function:

```python
def find_length(binary_string):
    max_diff = 0
    current_sum = 0
    min_sum = 0  # This will track the minimum sum encountered

    for char in binary_string:
        # Transform '0' to +1 and '1' to -1
        if char == '0':
            current_sum += 1
        else:
            current_sum -= 1
        
        # Update max_diff
        max_diff = max(max_diff, current_sum - min_sum)
        
        # Update min_sum
        min_sum = min(min_sum, current_sum)

    return max_diff
```

This function will correctly compute the maximum difference between the number of 0s and 1s in any substring of the given binary string.

At each round of conversation, I will give you

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/125 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided in the context is mostly correct and outlines a valid approach to solving the problem. The transformation of the binary string into a numerical representation and the use of a running sum to track the maximum difference is a sound strategy. However, the implementation in the context is not complete and needs to be encapsulated in a function with the correct name and structure.

Plan:
1) Define the function `find_length` that takes a binary string as input.
2) Initialize variables to track the maximum difference (`max_diff`), the current sum (`current_sum`), and the minimum sum encountered (`min_sum`).
3) Iterate through each character in the binary string:
   - Transform '0' to +1 and '1' to -1, updating the `current_sum` accordingly.
   - Update `max_diff` to be the maximum of its current value and the difference between `current_sum` and `min_sum`.
   - Update `min_sum` to be the minimum of its current value and `current_sum`.
4) Return the `max_diff` as the result.

Code:
```python
def find_length(binary_string: str) -> int:
    max_diff = 0
    current_sum = 0
    min_sum = 0  # This will track the minimum sum encountered

        max_diff = max(max_diff, current_sum - min_sum)
