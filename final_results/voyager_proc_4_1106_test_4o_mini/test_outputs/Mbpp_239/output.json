    "reasoning": "The implementation failed the test case because it does not correctly count the number of valid sequences. The recursive call to `get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n - 1)` does not take into account the current starting integer `x`, which means it is not generating sequences based on the constraints of the problem. Instead, it is repeatedly counting sequences from the same starting point without considering the valid range for the next elements in the sequence.",
    "success": false,
    "critique": "To fix the implementation, you need to ensure that for each valid starting integer `x`, you recursively count the sequences that can be formed starting from `2 * x` up to `m`. This means you should modify the recursive call to `get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n - 1)` to start from `next_start` (which is `2 * x`) and ensure that you are counting sequences that respect the constraints of the problem."
