INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/560 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the union of the elements of two given tuples and outputting them in sorted order, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Combine the Tuples**: Start by merging the two tuples into a single collection. You can do this by converting both tuples into a set, which automatically handles duplicates.

2. **Create a Set**: Use the `set()` function to create a set from the combined elements of both tuples. This will ensure that only unique elements are retained.

3. **Sort the Elements**: Convert the set back into a list and sort it using the `sorted()` function. This will give you the elements in ascending order.

4. **Return as a Tuple**: Finally, convert the sorted list back into a tuple before returning it, as the output needs to be in tuple format.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def union_elements(tuple1, tuple2):
    # Step 1: Combine the tuples into a set to remove duplicates
    combined_set = set(tuple1) | set(tuple2)  # Union of both sets
    
    # Step 2: Sort the unique elements
    sorted_elements = sorted(combined_set)
    
    # Step 3: Convert the sorted list back to a tuple
    return tuple(sorted_elements)
```

This function will take two tuples as input, find their union, sort the unique elements, and return them as a new tuple. The assertion provided in the question can be used to verify that the function works correctly.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
