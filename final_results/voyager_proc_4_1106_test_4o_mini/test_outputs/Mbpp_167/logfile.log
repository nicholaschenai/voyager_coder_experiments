"""
Write a python function to find the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to n.
assert next_power_of_2(0) == 1
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/167 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to a given number `n`, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understanding Powers of 2**: Powers of 2 are numbers like 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. These can be represented as \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, \ldots\).

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The smallest power of 2 is 1 (which is \(2^0\)). Therefore, if `n` is 0, the function should return 1.

3. **Iterative Approach**: You can start from the smallest power of 2 (which is 1) and keep multiplying by 2 until you reach a value that is greater than or equal to `n`.

4. **Using Bit Manipulation**: Alternatively, you can use bit manipulation to find the next power of 2. This involves checking the binary representation of the number and determining the next highest power of 2.

5. **Return the Result**: Once you find the appropriate power of 2, return that value.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic in Python:

```python
def next_power_of_2(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 1
    power = 1
    while power < n:
        power *= 2
    return power

# Example usage
assert next_power_of_2(0) == 1
```

This function checks if `n` is less than or equal to 0 and returns 1 in that case. Otherwise, it starts with `power` set to 1 and keeps doubling it until it finds a value that is greater than or equal to `n`.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to a given number `n`, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understanding Powers of 2**: Powers of 2 are numbers like 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. These can be represented as \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, \ldots\).

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/167 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct and outlines a clear approach to finding the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `n`. The implementation logic is sound, but it can be optimized using bit manipulation for efficiency. However, since the task requires a straightforward implementation, the iterative approach is also valid.

Plan:
1) Check if `n` is less than or equal to 0. If so, return 1, as the smallest power of 2 is 1.
2) Initialize a variable `power` to 1, which represents the current power of 2.
3) Use a while loop to multiply `power` by 2 until it is greater than or equal to `n`.
4) Return the value of `power` once the loop condition is satisfied.

```python
def next_power_of_2(n: int) -> int:
