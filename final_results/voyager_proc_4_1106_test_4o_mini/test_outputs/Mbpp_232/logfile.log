Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and returns a list containing the n largest items from the list.

"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/232 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of writing a function that returns the n largest items from a list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function that takes two parameters: a list and an integer n.

2. **Sort the List**: You can sort the list in descending order. This will allow you to easily access the largest elements.

3. **Select the Largest Items**: After sorting, you can slice the list to get the first n elements, which will be the largest items.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the sliced list containing the n largest items.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def larg_nnum(input_list, n):
    # Step 1: Sort the list in descending order
    sorted_list = sorted(input_list, reverse=True)
    
    # Step 2: Slice the first n elements
    largest_items = sorted_list[:n]
    
    # Step 3: Return the result
    return largest_items
```

5. **Testing the Function**: You can use assertions to test if the function works as expected, as shown in the provided assertion.

This approach is straightforward and leverages Python's built-in sorting capabilities to achieve the desired result efficiently.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/232 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct and outlines the necessary steps to implement the function. However, it does not mention the need to ensure that the function can handle cases where the input list has fewer than n elements. Additionally, the function name must strictly follow the specified name `larg_nnum`.

Plan:
1) Define the function `larg_nnum` that takes a list and an integer n as parameters.
2) Sort the input list in descending order to bring the largest elements to the front.
3) Slice the sorted list to get the first n elements, ensuring that if n is greater than the length of the list, it only returns the available elements.
4) Return the sliced list containing the n largest items.
