"""
Write a function to find the maximum difference between available pairs in the given tuple list.
assert max_difference([(3, 5), (1, 7), (10, 3), (1, 2)]) == 7
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/63 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the maximum difference between available pairs in a given list of tuples in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Iterate through the list of tuples**: You need to loop through each tuple in the list to access the individual pairs of numbers.

2. **Calculate the difference for each pair**: For each tuple, calculate the absolute difference between the two numbers. This can be done using the `abs()` function, which returns the absolute value of a number.

3. **Track the maximum difference**: As you calculate the difference for each pair, keep track of the maximum difference encountered so far. You can initialize a variable to hold the maximum difference and update it whenever you find a larger difference.

4. **Return the maximum difference**: After iterating through all the tuples, return the maximum difference found.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def max_difference(tuples_list):
    max_diff = 0  # Initialize the maximum difference
    for a, b in tuples_list:  # Iterate through each tuple
        diff = abs(a - b)  # Calculate the absolute difference
        if diff > max_diff:  # Check if it's the largest difference found
            max_diff = diff  # Update the maximum difference
    return max_diff  # Return the maximum difference
```

This function will correctly compute the maximum difference for the provided list of tuples.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the maximum difference between available pairs in a given list of tuples in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Iterate through the list of tuples**: You need to loop through each tuple in the list to access the individual pairs of numbers.

2. **Calculate the difference for each pair**: For each tuple, calculate the absolute difference between the two numbers. This can be done using the `abs()` function, which returns the absolute value of a number.

3. **Track the maximum difference**: As you calculate the difference for each pair, keep track of the maximum difference encountered so far. You can initialize a variable to hold the maximum difference and update it whenever you find a larger difference.

4. **Return the maximum difference**: After iterating through all the tuples, return the maximum difference found.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def max_difference(tuples_list):
    max_diff = 0  # Initialize the maximum difference
    for a, b in tuples_list:  # Iterate through each tuple
        diff = abs(a - b)  # Calculate the absolute difference
        if diff > max_diff:  # Check if it's the largest difference found
            max_diff = diff  # Update the maximum difference
    return max_diff  # Return the maximum difference
```

This function will correctly compute the maximum difference for the provided list of tuples.
