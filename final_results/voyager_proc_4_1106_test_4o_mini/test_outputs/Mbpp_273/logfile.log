INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/273 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of subtracting the elements of two tuples by their corresponding indices in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function that takes two tuples as parameters.

2. **Use a Loop or Comprehension**: Iterate over the indices of the tuples. Since tuples are of fixed size, you can use the `range` function to generate indices based on the length of one of the tuples.

3. **Subtract Elements**: For each index, subtract the element of the second tuple from the element of the first tuple.

4. **Store Results**: Collect the results of the subtractions into a new tuple.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the new tuple containing the results of the subtractions.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def substract_elements(tuple1, tuple2):
    # Ensure both tuples are of the same length
    if len(tuple1) != len(tuple2):
        raise ValueError("Tuples must be of the same length")
    
    # Use a tuple comprehension to subtract elements
    result = tuple(tuple1[i] - tuple2[i] for i in range(len(tuple1)))
    
    return result
```

In this function:
- We first check if the tuples are of the same length to avoid index errors.
- We then use a generator expression inside the `tuple()` constructor to create a new tuple with the results of the subtractions.

This approach is efficient and leverages Python's tuple and comprehension features effectively.
