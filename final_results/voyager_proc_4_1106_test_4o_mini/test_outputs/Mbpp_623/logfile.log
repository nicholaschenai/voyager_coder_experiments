INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/623 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of computing the n-th power of each number in a list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes two parameters: a list of numbers and the exponent `n`.

2. **Iterate Over the List**: Use a loop (like a `for` loop) to iterate over each number in the provided list.

3. **Compute the Power**: For each number, compute its n-th power using the exponentiation operator `**`.

4. **Store the Results**: Collect the results of the computations in a new list.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the new list containing the n-th powers of the original numbers.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def nth_nums(numbers, n):
    result = []  # Step 4: Initialize an empty list to store results
    for number in numbers:  # Step 2: Iterate over each number in the list
        result.append(number ** n)  # Step 3: Compute the n-th power and store it
    return result  # Step 5: Return the list of results
```

You can then use this function and assert that it works as expected with the provided test case.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of computing the n-th power of each number in a list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes two parameters: a list of numbers and the exponent `n`.

2. **Iterate Over the List**: Use a loop (like a `for` loop) to iterate over each number in the provided list.

3. **Compute the Power**: For each number, compute its n-th power using the exponentiation operator `**`.

4. **Store the Results**: Collect the results of the computations in a new list.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the new list containing the n-th powers of the original numbers.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def nth_nums(numbers, n):
    result = []  # Step 4: Initialize an empty list to store results
    for number in numbers:  # Step 2: Iterate over each number in the list
        result.append(number ** n)  # Step 3: Compute the n-th power and store it
    return result  # Step 5: Return the list of results
```

You can then use this function and assert that it works as expected with the provided test case.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/623 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is a good outline for the task. It correctly identifies the need to define a function that takes a list and an exponent, iterates through the list, computes the n-th power for each element, and returns the results. The plan is complete and follows the requirements specified in the task.

Plan:
1) Define the function `nth_nums` that takes a list of numbers and an integer `n` as parameters.
2) Initialize an empty list to store the results of the n-th powers.
3) Use a for loop to iterate over each number in the input list.
4) For each number, compute its n-th power using the exponentiation operator `**` and append the result to the results list.
5) Return the results list after the loop completes.

    result = []
    for number in numbers:
        result.append(number ** n)
    return result
