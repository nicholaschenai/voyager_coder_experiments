INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/280 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of writing a function that checks if an element is in an array and returns its index, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function that takes two parameters: the array (list) and the element to search for.

2. **Iterate Through the Array**: Use a loop to go through each element in the array. You can use a `for` loop with `enumerate()` to get both the index and the value of each element.

3. **Check for the Element**: Inside the loop, compare each element with the target element. If a match is found, return a tuple containing `True` and the index of the found element.

4. **Handle the Case Where the Element is Not Found**: If the loop completes without finding the element, return a tuple containing `False` and `-1`.

5. **Return the Result**: Ensure that the function returns the appropriate tuple based on whether the element was found or not.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def sequential_search(array, element):
    for index, value in enumerate(array):
        if value == element:
            return (True, index)
    return (False, -1)
```

This function will check each element in the array and return the desired result as specified in the assertion.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
