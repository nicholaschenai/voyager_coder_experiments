"""
Write a function to convert a date of yyyy-mm-dd format to dd-mm-yyyy format.
assert change_date_format("2026-01-02") == '02-01-2026'
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/427 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of converting a date from the format `yyyy-mm-dd` to `dd-mm-yyyy` in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `change_date_format` that takes a string parameter representing the date.

2. **Split the Date String**: Use the `split` method to break the input string into its components (year, month, and day) based on the hyphen (`-`) delimiter.

3. **Rearrange the Components**: Rearrange the components from the split operation to match the desired output format. Specifically, you will need to reorder them from `[year, month, day]` to `[day, month, year]`.

4. **Join the Components**: Use the `join` method to concatenate the rearranged components back into a single string, using hyphens as separators.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the newly formatted date string.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def change_date_format(date_str):
    # Step 2: Split the input date string
    year, month, day = date_str.split('-')
    
    # Step 3: Rearrange the components
    # Step 4: Join the components in the new order
    new_date_str = '-'.join([day, month, year])
    
    # Step 5: Return the result
    return new_date_str
```

With this function, calling `change_date_format("2026-01-02")` will return `'02-01-2026'`, as expected.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of converting a date from the format `yyyy-mm-dd` to `dd-mm-yyyy` in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `change_date_format` that takes a string parameter representing the date.

2. **Split the Date String**: Use the `split` method to break the input string into its components (year, month, and day) based on the hyphen (`-`) delimiter.

3. **Rearrange the Components**: Rearrange the components from the split operation to match the desired output format. Specifically, you will need to reorder them from `[year, month, day]` to `[day, month, year]`.

4. **Join the Components**: Use the `join` method to concatenate the rearranged components back into a single string, using hyphens as separators.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the newly formatted date string.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def change_date_format(date_str):
    # Step 2: Split the input date string
    year, month, day = date_str.split('-')
    
    # Step 3: Rearrange the components
    # Step 4: Join the components in the new order
    new_date_str = '-'.join([day, month, year])
    
    # Step 5: Return the result
    return new_date_str
```

With this function, calling `change_date_format("2026-01-02")` will return `'02-01-2026'`, as expected.
