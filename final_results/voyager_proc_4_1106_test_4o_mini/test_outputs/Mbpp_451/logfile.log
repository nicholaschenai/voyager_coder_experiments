"""
Write a function to remove all whitespaces from the given string.
assert remove_whitespaces(' Google    Flutter ') == 'GoogleFlutter'
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/451 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of removing all whitespaces from a given string in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function named `remove_whitespaces` that takes a single parameter, which will be the input string.

2. **Use String Methods**: Within the function, you can utilize the `replace()` method of the string class. This method allows you to replace all occurrences of a specified substring (in this case, a whitespace character) with another substring (in this case, an empty string).

3. **Return the Result**: After replacing all whitespaces, return the modified string.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def remove_whitespaces(input_string):
    # Replace all whitespace characters with an empty string
    return input_string.replace(' ', '')
```

4. **Testing the Function**: You can then use an assertion to test if the function works as expected by comparing the output of the function with the expected result.

By following these steps, you can effectively remove all whitespaces from a string in Python.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of removing all whitespaces from a given string in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function named `remove_whitespaces` that takes a single parameter, which will be the input string.

2. **Use String Methods**: Within the function, you can utilize the `replace()` method of the string class. This method allows you to replace all occurrences of a specified substring (in this case, a whitespace character) with another substring (in this case, an empty string).

3. **Return the Result**: After replacing all whitespaces, return the modified string.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def remove_whitespaces(input_string):
    # Replace all whitespace characters with an empty string
    return input_string.replace(' ', '')
```

4. **Testing the Function**: You can then use an assertion to test if the function works as expected by comparing the output of the function with the expected result.

By following these steps, you can effectively remove all whitespaces from a string in Python.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/451 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct, but it only accounts for spaces (' ') and does not consider other types of whitespace characters such as tabs ('\t') or newlines ('\n'). To ensure that all types of whitespace are removed, we should use a more comprehensive approach.

Plan:
1) Define a function named `remove_whitespaces` that takes a single string parameter.
2) Use the `str.replace()` method in a loop or use the `str.join()` method with a generator expression to remove all types of whitespace characters.
3) Return the modified string without any whitespace.
