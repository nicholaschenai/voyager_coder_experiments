"""
Write a python function to find the sum of fourth power of first n odd natural numbers.
assert odd_num_sum(2) == 82
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/770 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the sum of the fourth power of the first n odd natural numbers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Identify Odd Natural Numbers**: The first n odd natural numbers can be generated using a simple formula. The k-th odd natural number can be expressed as `2*k - 1`, where `k` ranges from 1 to n.

2. **Calculate the Fourth Power**: For each odd number generated, compute its fourth power. This can be done using the exponentiation operator `**` in Python.

3. **Sum the Values**: Initialize a variable to accumulate the sum of these fourth powers. Loop through the first n odd numbers, calculate their fourth power, and add it to the sum.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the computed sum.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def odd_num_sum(n):
    total_sum = 0
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        odd_number = 2 * k - 1  # Generate the k-th odd number
        total_sum += odd_number ** 4  # Add its fourth power to the total sum
    return total_sum
```

In this function:
- We loop from 1 to n to get the first n odd numbers.
- For each odd number, we calculate its fourth power and add it to `total_sum`.
- Finally, we return `total_sum`, which gives us the desired result.

The assertion `assert odd_num_sum(2) == 82` checks that the function works correctly for the input `n = 2`, where the first two odd numbers are 1 and 3, and their fourth powers are 1 and 81, respectively, summing to 82.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the sum of the fourth power of the first n odd natural numbers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Identify Odd Natural Numbers**: The first n odd natural numbers can be generated using a simple formula. The k-th odd natural number can be expressed as `2*k - 1`, where `k` ranges from 1 to n.

2. **Calculate the Fourth Power**: For each odd number generated, compute its fourth power. This can be done using the exponentiation operator `**` in Python.

3. **Sum the Values**: Initialize a variable to accumulate the sum of these fourth powers. Loop through the first n odd numbers, calculate their fourth power, and add it to the sum.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the computed sum.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def odd_num_sum(n):
    total_sum = 0
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        odd_number = 2 * k - 1  # Generate the k-th odd number
        total_sum += odd_number ** 4  # Add its fourth power to the total sum
    return total_sum
```

In this function:
- We loop from 1 to n to get the first n odd numbers.
- For each odd number, we calculate its fourth power and add it to `total_sum`.
- Finally, we return `total_sum`, which gives us the desired result.

The assertion `assert odd_num_sum(2) == 82` checks that the function works correctly for the input `n = 2`, where the first two odd numbers are 1 and 3, and their fourth powers are 1 and 81, respectively, summing to 82.

The function will generate the odd numbers, compute their fourth powers, and sum them up. The assertion provided will verify that the implementation is correct.

Plan:
1) Define the function `odd_num_sum` that takes an integer `n` as input.
2) Initialize a variable `total_sum` to 0 to keep track of the cumulative sum of the fourth powers.
3) Use a loop to iterate from 1 to `n`, generating the k-th odd number using the formula `2*k - 1`.
4) For each odd number, calculate its fourth power and add it to `total_sum`.
