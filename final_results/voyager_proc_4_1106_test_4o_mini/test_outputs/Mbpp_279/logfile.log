INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/279 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to find the nth decagonal number.
assert is_num_decagonal(3) == 27
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/279 [generation text] Answer: To find the nth decagonal number in Python, you can use the formula for the nth decagonal number, which is given by:

\[ D(n) = n \times (4n - 3) \]

This formula derives from the general formula for polygonal numbers, where "decagonal" refers to a 10-sided polygon.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of how to accomplish this task:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `decagonal_number` that takes an integer `n` as an argument.

2. **Implement the Formula**: Inside the function, use the formula \( D(n) = n \times (4n - 3) \) to calculate the nth decagonal number.

3. **Return the Result**: The function should return the calculated decagonal number.

4. **Create an Assertion Function**: To check if a number is decagonal, you can create a function `is_num_decagonal` that checks if a given number matches the decagonal number for a specific `n`.

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def decagonal_number(n):
    return n * (4 * n - 3)

def is_num_decagonal(num):
    # Check if there exists an n such that the decagonal number equals num
    n = 1
    while True:
        decagonal = decagonal_number(n)
        if decagonal == num:
            return True
        elif decagonal > num:
            return False
        n += 1

# Example usage
assert is_num_decagonal(decagonal_number(3)) == True  # This should return True
```

In this code:
- The `decagonal_number` function computes the nth decagonal number.
- The `is_num_decagonal` function checks if a given number is a decagonal number by iterating through possible values of `n` until it finds a match or exceeds the number.

This approach allows you to find and verify decagonal numbers effectively.

At each round of conversation, I will give you

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
