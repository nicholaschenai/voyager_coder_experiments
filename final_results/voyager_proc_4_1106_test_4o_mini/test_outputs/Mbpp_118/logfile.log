INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/118 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of converting a string to a list of strings split on the space character in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function named `string_to_list` that takes a single parameter, which will be the input string.

2. **Use the `split` Method**: Inside the function, utilize the built-in `split()` method of string objects. By default, `split()` will split the string at whitespace characters (including spaces, tabs, and newlines) and return a list of substrings.

3. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the list of strings generated by the `split()` method.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def string_to_list(input_string):
    # Split the input string on spaces and return the resulting list
    return input_string.split()
```

4. **Testing the Function**: You can test the function using the provided assertion to ensure it works as expected.

By following these steps, you can effectively convert a string into a list of strings based on spaces.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/118 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct and outlines the necessary steps to accomplish the task. The use of the `split()` method is appropriate for splitting a string into a list based on whitespace. However, the plan does not explicitly mention the function signature and return type, which are important to adhere to the requirements of the task.

Plan:
1) Define the function `string_to_list` that takes a single string parameter.
2) Use the `split()` method on the input string to convert it into a list of substrings based on spaces.
3) Return the resulting list of strings.
