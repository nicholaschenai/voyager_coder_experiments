"""
Write a function to remove all whitespaces from a string.
assert remove_all_spaces('python  program')==('pythonprogram')
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/800 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of removing all whitespaces from a string in Python, you can define a function called `remove_all_spaces`. The function will take a string as an input and return a new string with all whitespace characters removed.

Conceptually, you can achieve this by using the `replace()` method of strings, which allows you to replace specified substrings with another substring. In this case, you would replace all occurrences of a space (' ') with an empty string (''). 

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step outline of how you can implement this:

1. Define the function `remove_all_spaces` that takes a single parameter (the input string).
2. Use the `replace()` method to replace all spaces in the input string with an empty string.
3. Return the modified string.

Here is a simple implementation of the function:

```python
def remove_all_spaces(input_string):
    return input_string.replace(' ', '')
```

You can then use the `assert` statement to verify that the function works as expected by checking if the output of the function matches the expected result.

```python
assert remove_all_spaces('python  program') == 'pythonprogram'
```

This will confirm that the function correctly removes all spaces from the input string.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/800 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct, but it can be improved by considering other types of whitespace characters, not just spaces. The `replace()` method will only remove spaces, but there are other whitespace characters like tabs (`\t`) and newlines (`\n`) that should also be removed. A more comprehensive approach would be to use the `str.replace()` method for spaces and also consider using `str.join()` with `str.split()` to handle all types of whitespace.

Plan:
1) Define the function `remove_all_spaces` that takes a single parameter (the input string).
2) Use the `str.split()` method to split the string into a list of words, which automatically removes all types of whitespace.
3) Use `str.join()` to concatenate the list of words back into a single string without any spaces.
4) Return the modified string.

def remove_all_spaces(input_string: str) -> str:
