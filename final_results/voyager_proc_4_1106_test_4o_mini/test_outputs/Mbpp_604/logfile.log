"""
Write a function to reverse words seperated by spaces in a given string.
assert reverse_words("python program")==("program python")
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/604 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of reversing words separated by spaces in a given string in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Split the String**: Use the `split()` method to break the input string into a list of words. By default, `split()` will separate the string at spaces.

2. **Reverse the List**: Use Python's list slicing or the `reverse()` method to reverse the order of the words in the list.

3. **Join the Words**: Use the `join()` method to concatenate the reversed list of words back into a single string, with a space as the separator.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the newly formed string.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps in a function:

```python
def reverse_words(s):
    words = s.split()          # Step 1: Split the string into words
    words.reverse()            # Step 2: Reverse the list of words
    return ' '.join(words)    # Step 3: Join the words back into a string
```

You can then use the `assert` statement to verify that the function works as expected:

```python
assert reverse_words("python program") == "program python"
```

This will check if the output of the function matches the expected result. If it does, the assertion will pass without any error.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/604 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided in the context is correct and outlines the necessary steps to reverse the words in a string. The implementation of the function `reverse_words` is also accurate and follows the steps outlined in the plan. There are no missing steps, and the function should work as intended.

Plan:
1) Define the function `reverse_words` that takes a string as input.
2) Use the `split()` method to break the input string into a list of words.
3) Reverse the list of words using the `reverse()` method or list slicing.
4) Use the `join()` method to concatenate the reversed list of words into a single string with spaces in between.
5) Return the resulting string.

Code:
```python
def reverse_words(s: str) -> str:
    words = s.split()          # Step 2: Split the string into words
    words.reverse()            # Step 3: Reverse the list of words
