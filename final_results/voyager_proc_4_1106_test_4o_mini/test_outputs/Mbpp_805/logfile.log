"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/805 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the list with the highest sum of elements from a list of lists in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a list of lists as an argument.

2. **Initialize Variables**: Inside the function, initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum sum found so far and another variable to store the corresponding list.

3. **Iterate Through the Lists**: Use a loop to iterate through each sublist in the input list of lists.

4. **Calculate the Sum**: For each sublist, calculate the sum of its elements using the built-in `sum()` function.

5. **Compare Sums**: Check if the calculated sum is greater than the current maximum sum. If it is, update the maximum sum and store the current sublist as the one with the highest sum.

6. **Return the Result**: After checking all sublists, return the sublist that has the highest sum.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def max_sum_list(lists):
    max_sum = float('-inf')  # Start with the lowest possible value
    max_list = []  # This will hold the list with the highest sum
    
    for sublist in lists:
        current_sum = sum(sublist)  # Calculate the sum of the current sublist
        
        if current_sum > max_sum:  # Check if it's greater than the max found so far
            max_sum = current_sum  # Update the max sum
            max_list = sublist  # Update the list with the highest sum
            
    return max_list  # Return the list with the highest sum
```

This function will correctly identify and return the sublist with the highest sum when called with the provided example.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the list with the highest sum of elements from a list of lists in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

            max_list = sublist  # Update the list with the highest sum
            
    return max_list  # Return the list with the highest sum
```

This function will correctly identify and return the sublist with the highest sum when called with the provided example.
