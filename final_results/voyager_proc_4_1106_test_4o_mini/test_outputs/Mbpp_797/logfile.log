"""
Write a python function to find the sum of all odd natural numbers within the range l and r.
assert sum_in_range(2,5) == 8
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/797 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the sum of all odd natural numbers within a specified range \( l \) and \( r \) in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `sum_in_range` that takes two parameters, \( l \) and \( r \).

2. **Initialize a Sum Variable**: Start with a variable to hold the sum of odd numbers, initialized to zero.

3. **Iterate Through the Range**: Use a loop to iterate through all numbers from \( l \) to \( r \) (inclusive).

4. **Check for Odd Numbers**: For each number in the loop, check if it is odd. A number is odd if it is not divisible by 2 (i.e., `number % 2 != 0`).

5. **Add to Sum**: If the number is odd, add it to the sum variable.

6. **Return the Result**: After the loop, return the sum of the odd numbers.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def sum_in_range(l, r):
    total_sum = 0
    for number in range(l, r + 1):
        if number % 2 != 0:  # Check if the number is odd
            total_sum += number  # Add odd number to the sum
    return total_sum
```

This function can then be tested with the assertion provided in the question to ensure it works correctly.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

It clearly defines the function, initializes a sum variable, iterates through the specified range, checks for odd numbers, and returns the sum. There are no missing steps in the plan.

Plan:
1) Define the function `sum_in_range` that takes two parameters, `l` and `r`.
2) Initialize a variable `total_sum` to zero to hold the sum of odd numbers.
3) Use a loop to iterate through all numbers from `l` to `r` (inclusive).
4) Check if each number is odd using the condition `number % 2 != 0`.
5) If the number is odd, add it to `total_sum`.
6) After the loop, return `total_sum`.

def sum_in_range(l: int, r: int) -> int:
    total_sum = 0
    for number in range(l, r + 1):
