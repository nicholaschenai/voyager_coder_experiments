INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/641 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to find the nth nonagonal number.
assert is_nonagonal(10) == 325
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/641 [generation text] Answer: To find the nth nonagonal number in Python, you first need to understand the formula for nonagonal numbers. The nth nonagonal number can be calculated using the formula:

\[ P(n) = \frac{n(7n - 5)}{2} \]

where \( P(n) \) is the nth nonagonal number.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of how to accomplish this task:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `nonagonal_number` that takes an integer \( n \) as an argument.

2. **Implement the Formula**: Inside the function, use the formula mentioned above to calculate the nth nonagonal number.

3. **Return the Result**: The function should return the calculated nonagonal number.

4. **Create an Assertion Function**: You can also define a helper function `is_nonagonal` that checks if a given number is a nonagonal number by calculating the nonagonal numbers up to a certain limit and checking for membership.

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def nonagonal_number(n):
    return n * (7 * n - 5) // 2

def is_nonagonal(num):
    # Check if num is a nonagonal number
    n = 1
    while True:
        nonagonal = nonagonal_number(n)
        if nonagonal == num:
            return True
        elif nonagonal > num:
            return False
        n += 1

# Example usage
assert is_nonagonal(nonagonal_number(10)) == True
assert nonagonal_number(10) == 325
```

In this code:
- The `nonagonal_number` function computes the nth nonagonal number.
- The `is_nonagonal` function checks if a given number is a nonagonal number by generating nonagonal numbers until it either finds the number or surpasses it.

This approach allows you to find and verify nonagonal numbers effectively.
