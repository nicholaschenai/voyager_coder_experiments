"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/752 [generation text] Answer: To find the nth Jacobsthal number in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand the Jacobsthal Sequence**: The Jacobsthal numbers are defined recursively. The first two numbers are 0 and 1, and for n >= 2, the nth Jacobsthal number can be calculated using the formula:
   - J(n) = J(n-1) + 2 * J(n-2)
   This means that each number in the sequence is the sum of the previous number and twice the number before that.

2. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `jacobsthal_num` that takes an integer `n` as an argument.

3. **Base Cases**: Inside the function, handle the base cases:
   - If `n` is 0, return 0.
   - If `n` is 1, return 1.

4. **Recursive or Iterative Calculation**: You can choose to implement the function either recursively or iteratively:
   - **Recursive Approach**: Call the function recursively for `n-1` and `n-2`, but be cautious of performance for larger `n` due to repeated calculations.
   - **Iterative Approach**: Use a loop to calculate the Jacobsthal numbers up to `n`, storing the results in a list or using two variables to keep track of the last two numbers.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the nth Jacobsthal number.

Here is a simple implementation using the iterative approach:

```python
def jacobsthal_num(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    
    # Initialize the first two Jacobsthal numbers
    j0, j1 = 0, 1
    
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        j_next = j1 + 2 * j0  # Calculate the next Jacobsthal number
        j0, j1 = j1, j_next   # Update the last two numbers
    
    return j1  # Return the nth Jacobsthal number
```

This function will correctly compute the nth Jacobsthal number, and you can test it with the assertion provided.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
