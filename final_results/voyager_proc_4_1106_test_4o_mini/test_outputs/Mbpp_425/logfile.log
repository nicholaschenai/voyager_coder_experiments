INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/425 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to count the number of sublists containing a particular element.
assert count_element_in_list([[1, 3], [5, 7], [1, 11], [1, 15, 7]],1)==3
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/425 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of counting the number of sublists that contain a particular element in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `count_element_in_list` that takes two parameters: a list of sublists and the element you want to count.

2. **Initialize a Counter**: Inside the function, initialize a counter variable to zero. This will keep track of how many sublists contain the specified element.

3. **Iterate Through Sublists**: Use a loop to iterate through each sublist in the main list.

4. **Check for Element**: For each sublist, check if the specified element is present. You can use the `in` keyword to check for membership.

5. **Update the Counter**: If the element is found in a sublist, increment the counter by one.

6. **Return the Count**: After checking all sublists, return the final count.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def count_element_in_list(sublists, element):
    count = 0
    for sublist in sublists:
        if element in sublist:
            count += 1
    return count
```

This function will correctly count and return the number of sublists that contain the specified element, as demonstrated by the provided assertion.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/425 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct and outlines the necessary steps to implement the function. The function `count_element_in_list` is defined with the correct parameters and logic to count the number of sublists containing a specific element. There are no missing steps, and the plan aligns well with the task requirements.

Plan:
1) Define the function `count_element_in_list` that takes two parameters: a list of sublists and the element to count.
2) Initialize a counter variable to zero to keep track of the number of sublists containing the specified element.
3) Iterate through each sublist in the main list using a for loop.
4) Check if the specified element is present in the current sublist using the `in` keyword.
5) If the element is found, increment the counter by one.
6) After iterating through all sublists, return the final count.

Code:
```python
def count_element_in_list(sublists, element):
    count = 0
