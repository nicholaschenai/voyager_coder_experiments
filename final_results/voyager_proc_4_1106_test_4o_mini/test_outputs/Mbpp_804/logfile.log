"""
Write a function to check whether the product of numbers in a list is even or not.
assert is_product_even([1,2,3])
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/804 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of checking whether the product of numbers in a list is even, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `is_product_even` that takes a list of numbers as an argument.

2. **Initialize a Product Variable**: Start with a variable to hold the product of the numbers, initializing it to 1 (since 1 is the multiplicative identity).

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to go through each number in the list. For each number, multiply it with the product variable.

4. **Check for Evenness**: After calculating the product, check if the product is even. A number is even if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., `product % 2 == 0`).

5. **Return the Result**: Return `True` if the product is even, and `False` otherwise.

6. **Use Assertions for Testing**: You can use assertions to test your function, as shown in the example.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def is_product_even(numbers):
    product = 1
    for number in numbers:
        product *= number
    return product % 2 == 0
```

In this function, if you call `is_product_even([1, 2, 3])`, it will return `True` because the product (6) is even.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of checking whether the product of numbers in a list is even, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `is_product_even` that takes a list of numbers as an argument.

2. **Initialize a Product Variable**: Start with a variable to hold the product of the numbers, initializing it to 1 (since 1 is the multiplicative identity).

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to go through each number in the list. For each number, multiply it with the product variable.

4. **Check for Evenness**: After calculating the product, check if the product is even. A number is even if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., `product % 2 == 0`).

5. **Return the Result**: Return `True` if the product is even, and `False` otherwise.

6. **Use Assertions for Testing**: You can use assertions to test your function, as shown in the example.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def is_product_even(numbers):
    product = 1
    for number in numbers:
        product *= number
    return product % 2 == 0
```

In this function, if you call `is_product_even([1, 2, 3])`, it will return `True` because the product (6) is even.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/804 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct and outlines the necessary steps to implement the function. However, it is important to note that calculating the product of all numbers in the list may not be necessary to determine if the product is even. Instead, we can simply check if any number in the list is even, as the product will be even if at least one of the numbers is even.

Plan:
1) Define a function named `is_product_even` that takes a list of numbers as an argument.
2) Iterate through the list of numbers.
3) Check if any number is even (i.e., if `number % 2 == 0`).
4) If an even number is found, return `True` immediately.
5) If the loop completes without finding an even number, return `False`.

Code:
```python
def is_product_even(numbers):
    for number in numbers:
        if number % 2 == 0:
            return True
    return False
