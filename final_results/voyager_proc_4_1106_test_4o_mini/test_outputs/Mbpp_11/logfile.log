INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/11 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
assert remove_Occ("hello","l") == "heo"
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/11 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of removing the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Identify the Character**: First, you need to determine the character that you want to remove from the string.

2. **Find Indices**: Use the string methods to find the index of the first occurrence and the last occurrence of the specified character. You can use the `str.find()` method to get the index of the first occurrence and `str.rfind()` for the last occurrence.

3. **Construct the New String**: Once you have the indices, you can construct a new string by slicing the original string. You will take the substring from the start of the string up to the first occurrence (not including it), and then take the substring from the character after the first occurrence to the character before the last occurrence, and finally append the substring from the last occurrence onward (not including it).

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the newly constructed string.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def remove_Occ(s, char):
    first_index = s.find(char)
    last_index = s.rfind(char)
    
    if first_index == -1 or first_index == last_index:
        # If the character is not found or only one occurrence exists
        return s.replace(char, "", 1)  # Remove only one occurrence
    
    # Construct the new string
    new_string = s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
    return new_string
```

This function will effectively remove the first and last occurrences of the specified character from the input string.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/11 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided in the context is mostly correct and outlines the necessary steps to achieve the task. However, it does not account for the case where the character may not exist in the string or when the first and last occurrences are the same (i.e., when there is only one occurrence of the character). The plan also needs to ensure that the function handles these edge cases properly.

Plan:
1. Define the function `remove_Occ` that takes a string `s` and a character `char` as input.
2. Use `str.find()` to get the index of the first occurrence of `char`.
3. Use `str.rfind()` to get the index of the last occurrence of `char`.
4. Check if the first index is -1 (character not found) or if the first and last indices are the same (only one occurrence). If either condition is true, return the string with only the first occurrence of the character removed.
5. If both indices are valid and different, construct the new string by concatenating:
   - The substring before the first occurrence.
   - The substring between the first and last occurrences (excluding both).
   - The substring after the last occurrence.
6. Return the newly constructed string.

Code:
```python
def remove_Occ(s: str, char: str) -> str:
    first_index = s.find(char)
    last_index = s.rfind(char)
    
    if first_index == -1 or first_index == last_index:
        return s.replace(char, "", 1)  # Remove only one occurrence
