"""
Write a function to subtract two lists element-wise.
assert sub_list([1, 2, 3],[4,5,6])==[-3,-3,-3]
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/282 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of subtracting two lists element-wise in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `sub_list` that takes two lists as parameters.

2. **Check Lengths**: Ensure that both lists are of the same length. If they are not, you may want to handle this case by raising an error or returning a specific value.

3. **Element-wise Subtraction**: Use a loop or a list comprehension to iterate through the elements of both lists simultaneously. For each pair of elements (one from each list), subtract the second element from the first.

4. **Return the Result**: Collect the results of the subtraction into a new list and return this list.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def sub_list(list1, list2):
    if len(list1) != len(list2):
        raise ValueError("Lists must be of the same length")
    return [a - b for a, b in zip(list1, list2)]
```

In this implementation:
- `zip(list1, list2)` pairs up the elements from both lists.
- The list comprehension `[a - b for a, b in zip(list1, list2)]` performs the subtraction for each pair of elements.

You can then use the `assert` statement to verify that the function works as expected:

```python
assert sub_list([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]) == [-3, -3, -3]
```

This will confirm that the function correctly subtracts the two lists element-wise.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

2) Check if the lengths of both lists are equal; if not, raise a `ValueError`.
3) Use a list comprehension to iterate through both lists simultaneously and subtract the elements of the second list from the first list.
4) Return the resulting list of differences.
