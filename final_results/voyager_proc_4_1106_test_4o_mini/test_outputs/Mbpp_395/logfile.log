"""
Write a python function to find the first non-repeated character in a given string.
assert first_non_repeating_character("abcabc") == None
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/395 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the first non-repeated character in a given string in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Count Character Frequencies**: Use a data structure, such as a dictionary or a `collections.Counter`, to count how many times each character appears in the string.

2. **Iterate Through the String**: Loop through the string again to check the frequency of each character.

3. **Identify the First Non-Repeated Character**: During the iteration, the first character that has a count of 1 in your frequency dictionary is the first non-repeated character.

4. **Return the Result**: If you find such a character, return it. If no non-repeated character exists, return `None`.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def first_non_repeating_character(s):
    # Step 1: Count frequencies
    char_count = {}
    for char in s:
        char_count[char] = char_count.get(char, 0) + 1
    
    # Step 2: Find the first non-repeated character
    for char in s:
        if char_count[char] == 1:
            return char
    
    # Step 3: If none found, return None
    return None
```

This function will correctly identify the first non-repeated character or return `None` if all characters are repeated, as specified in the assertion.

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the first non-repeated character in a given string in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Count Character Frequencies**: Use a data structure, such as a dictionary or a `collections.Counter`, to count how many times each character appears in the string.

2. **Iterate Through the String**: Loop through the string again to check the frequency of each character.

3. **Identify the First Non-Repeated Character**: During the iteration, the first character that has a count of 1 in your frequency dictionary is the first non-repeated character.

4. **Return the Result**: If you find such a character, return it. If no non-repeated character exists, return `None`.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def first_non_repeating_character(s):
    # Step 1: Count frequencies
    char_count = {}
    for char in s:
        char_count[char] = char_count.get(char, 0) + 1
    
    # Step 2: Find the first non-repeated character
    for char in s:
        if char_count[char] == 1:
            return char
    
    # Step 3: If none found, return None
    return None
```

This function will correctly identify the first non-repeated character or return `None` if all characters are repeated, as specified in the assertion.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/395 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided in the context is correct and outlines the necessary steps to find the first non-repeated character in a string. The function `first_non_repeating_character` is already defined in the earlier entries, and it implements the required logic effectively. The assertion provided in the task checks for a specific case where all characters are repeated, which the function should handle correctly.

Plan:
1) Use the `first_non_repeating_character` function from the earlier entries, as it already implements the required logic to find the first non-repeated character in a string.
2) Ensure that the function is called with the appropriate input to satisfy the assertion.
3) Return the result of the function call to verify it meets the assertion condition.

Code:
```python

    char_count = {}
    for char in s:
        if (char in char_count):
