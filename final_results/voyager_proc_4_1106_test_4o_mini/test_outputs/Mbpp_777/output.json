    "reasoning": "The implementation failed the test case because it incorrectly sums the non-repeated elements. The function is counting the occurrences correctly, but it seems to be summing the elements incorrectly, leading to an output of 20 instead of the expected 21.",
    "success": false,
    "critique": "The issue arises from the way the sum is calculated. The implementation correctly identifies the non-repeated elements, but it seems to be missing the inclusion of the element '6' in the sum. To fix this, ensure that the sum includes all non-repeated elements by verifying the logic in the summation step. You might want to check if the counting logic is correctly identifying all unique elements."
