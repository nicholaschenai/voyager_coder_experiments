"""
Write a function which returns nth catalan number.
assert catalan_number(10)==16796
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/583 [generation text] Answer: To compute the nth Catalan number in Python, you can use the formula for Catalan numbers, which is given by:

\[ C(n) = \frac{(2n)!}{(n+1)!n!} \]

This formula involves factorials, which can be computed using the `math.factorial` function in Python. Here's a conceptual breakdown of how to implement the function:

1. **Import the math module**: This module provides access to mathematical functions, including factorial.

2. **Define the function**: Create a function named `catalan_number` that takes an integer `n` as an argument.

3. **Calculate the factorials**: Use the `math.factorial` function to compute the factorial of `2n`, `n`, and `n+1`.

4. **Apply the Catalan formula**: Use the computed factorials to calculate the nth Catalan number using the formula mentioned above.

5. **Return the result**: Finally, return the computed Catalan number.

Here is a sample implementation of the function:

```python
import math

def catalan_number(n):
    return math.factorial(2 * n) // (math.factorial(n + 1) * math.factorial(n))

# Example usage
assert catalan_number(10) == 16796
```

This function will correctly compute the nth Catalan number, and the assertion will pass for `n = 10`.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
