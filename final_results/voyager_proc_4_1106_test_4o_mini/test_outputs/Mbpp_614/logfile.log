"""
Write a function to find the cumulative sum of all the values that are present in the given tuple list.

"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/614 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the cumulative sum of all the values in a given list of tuples in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a list of tuples as an argument.

2. **Initialize a Sum Variable**: Inside the function, initialize a variable to hold the cumulative sum, starting at zero.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to iterate through each tuple in the list.

4. **Iterate Through Each Tuple**: For each tuple, use another loop to iterate through its elements.

5. **Accumulate the Sum**: For each element in the tuple, add its value to the cumulative sum variable.

6. **Return the Result**: After processing all tuples, return the cumulative sum.

Here is a conceptual outline of the code:

```python
def cumulative_sum(tuple_list):
    total = 0  # Step 2: Initialize sum variable
    for tup in tuple_list:  # Step 3: Iterate through the list of tuples
        for value in tup:  # Step 4: Iterate through each tuple
            total += value  # Step 5: Accumulate the sum
    return total  # Step 6: Return the result
```

You can then use this function and assert the result as shown in your example. This approach effectively combines iteration and accumulation to achieve the desired outcome.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
