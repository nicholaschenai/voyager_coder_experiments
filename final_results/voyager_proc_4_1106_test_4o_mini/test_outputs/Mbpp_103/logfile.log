"""
Write a function to find the Eulerian number a(n, m).
assert eulerian_num(3, 1) == 4
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/103 [generation text] Answer: To find the Eulerian number \( A(n, m) \), which counts the number of permutations of \( n \) elements in which exactly \( m \) elements are greater than the previous element, you can use a recursive approach or dynamic programming.

Conceptually, the Eulerian number can be defined using the following recurrence relations:

1. **Base Cases**:
   - \( A(0, 0) = 1 \) (the empty permutation)
   - \( A(n, 0) = 1 \) for \( n \geq 1 \) (only one way to arrange \( n \) elements with no ascents)
   - \( A(n, n) = 0 \) for \( n \geq 1 \) (no way to arrange \( n \) elements with \( n \) ascents)

2. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - For \( n > 0 \) and \( 0 \leq m < n \):
     \[
     A(n, m) = (n - m) \cdot A(n - 1, m) + (m + 1) \cdot A(n - 1, m - 1)
     \]
   This relation combines the cases based on whether the largest element is at the end of the permutation or not.

To implement this in Python, you can create a function that uses either recursion with memoization or a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to fill a table of values for \( A(n, m) \).

Hereâ€™s a simple outline of how you might implement this:

```python
def eulerian_num(n, m):
    # Create a 2D list to store the Eulerian numbers
    A = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Base cases
    A[0][0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        A[i][0] = 1  # A(n, 0) = 1
        A[i][i] = 0  # A(n, n) = 0
    
    # Fill the table using the recurrence relation
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, i):
            A[i][j] = (i - j) * A[i - 1][j] + (j + 1) * A[i - 1][j - 1]
    
    return A[n][m]

# Example usage
assert eulerian_num(3, 1) == 4
```

This function initializes a table to store the values of the Eulerian numbers and fills it according to the defined recurrence relations. Finally, it returns the value of \( A(n, m) \).

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To find the Eulerian number \( A(n, m) \), which counts the number of permutations of \( n \) elements in which exactly \( m \) elements are greater than the previous element, you can use a recursive approach or dynamic programming.

Conceptually, the Eulerian number can be defined using the following recurrence relations:

   - \( A(n, 0) = 1 \) for \( n \geq 1 \) (only one way to arrange \( n \) elements with no ascents)
   - \( A(n, n) = 0 \) for \( n \geq 1 \) (no way to arrange \( n \) elements with \( n \) ascents)

2. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - For \( n > 0 \) and \( 0 \leq m < n \):
     \[
     A(n, m) = (n - m) \cdot A(n - 1, m) + (m + 1) \cdot A(n - 1, m - 1)
     \]
   This relation combines the cases based on whether the largest element is at the end of the permutation or not.

To implement this in Python, you can create a function that uses either recursion with memoization or a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to fill a table of values for \( A(n, m) \).

Hereâ€™s a simple outline of how you might implement this:

```python
def eulerian_num(n, m):
    # Create a 2D list to store the Eulerian numbers
    A = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Base cases
    A[0][0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        A[i][0] = 1  # A(n, 0) = 1
        A[i][i] = 0  # A(n, n) = 0
    
    # Fill the table using the recurrence relation
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, i):
            A[i][j] = (i - j) * A[i - 1][j] + (j + 1) * A[i - 1][j - 1]
    
    return A[n][m]

# Example usage
assert eulerian_num(3, 1) == 4
```

This function initializes a table to store the values of the Eulerian numbers and fills it according to the defined recurrence relations. Finally, it returns the value of \( A(n, m) \).

Conceptually, the Eulerian number can be defined using the following recurrence relations:

   - \( A(n, n) = 0 \) for \( n \geq 1 \) (no way to arrange \( n \) elements with \( n \) ascents)

2. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - For \( n > 0 \) and \( 0 \leq m < n \):
     \[
     A(n, m) = (n - m) \cdot A(n - 1, m) + (m + 1) \cdot A(n - 1, m - 1)

   This relation combines the cases based on whether the largest element is at the end of the permutation or not.

Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests

assert eulerian_num(3, 1) == 4
"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To find the Eulerian number \( A(n, m) \), which counts the number of permutations of \( n \) elements in which exactly \( m \) elements are greater than the previous element, you can use a recursive approach or dynamic programming.

Conceptually, the Eulerian number can be defined using the following recurrence relations:

1. **Base Cases**:
   - \( A(0, 0) = 1 \) (the empty permutation)
   - \( A(n, 0) = 1 \) for \( n \geq 1 \) (only one way to arrange \( n \) elements with no ascents)
   - \( A(n, n) = 0 \) for \( n \geq 1 \) (no way to arrange \( n \) elements with \( n \) ascents)

2. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - For \( n > 0 \) and \( 0 \leq m < n \):
     \[
     A(n, m) = (n - m) \cdot A(n - 1, m) + (m + 1) \cdot A(n - 1, m - 1)
     \]
   This relation combines the cases based on whether the largest element is at the end of the permutation or not.

To implement this in Python, you can create a function that uses either recursion with memoization or a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to fill a table of values for \( A(n, m) \).

Hereâ€™s a simple outline of how you might implement this:

```python
def eulerian_num(n, m):
    # Create a 2D list to store the Eulerian numbers
    A = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Base cases
    A[0][0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        A[i][0] = 1  # A(n, 0) = 1
        A[i][i] = 0  # A(n, n) = 0
    
    # Fill the table using the recurrence relation
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, i):
            A[i][j] = (i - j) * A[i - 1][j] + (j + 1) * A[i - 1][j - 1]
    
    return A[n][m]

# Example usage
assert eulerian_num(3, 1) == 4
```

This function initializes a table to store the values of the Eulerian numbers and fills it according to the defined recurrence relations. Finally, it returns the value of \( A(n, m) \).


[Critique]
The issue lies in the way the Eulerian numbers are being calculated. The recurrence relation should be carefully checked to ensure it aligns with the mathematical definition. Specifically, the base case for A(n, n) should be set correctly, and the logic in the nested loops should be verified to ensure that the correct values are being computed. Additionally, ensure that the indices used in the array are correctly aligned with the definitions of the Eulerian numbers.


INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/103 [generation text] Explain: The current implementation of the `eulerian_num` function has a mistake in the base case for \( A(n, n) \) and possibly in the recurrence relation. The assertion `assert eulerian_num(3, 1) == 4` is failing because the computed value does not match the expected value. The recurrence relation and the base cases need to be carefully defined to ensure they align with the mathematical definition of Eulerian numbers.

1) Initialize a 2D list `A` to store the Eulerian numbers, with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`.
2) Set the base case \( A(0, 0) = 1 \).
3) For \( n \geq 1 \), set \( A(n, 0) = 1 \) and \( A(n, n) = 0 \).

Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests

assert eulerian_num(3, 1) == 4
"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To find the Eulerian number \( A(n, m) \), which counts the number of permutations of \( n \) elements in which exactly \( m \) elements are greater than the previous element, you can use a recursive approach or dynamic programming.

Conceptually, the Eulerian number can be defined using the following recurrence relations:

1. **Base Cases**:
   - \( A(0, 0) = 1 \) (the empty permutation)
   - \( A(n, 0) = 1 \) for \( n \geq 1 \) (only one way to arrange \( n \) elements with no ascents)
   - \( A(n, n) = 0 \) for \( n \geq 1 \) (no way to arrange \( n \) elements with \( n \) ascents)

2. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - For \( n > 0 \) and \( 0 \leq m < n \):
     \[
     A(n, m) = (n - m) \cdot A(n - 1, m) + (m + 1) \cdot A(n - 1, m - 1)
     \]
   This relation combines the cases based on whether the largest element is at the end of the permutation or not.

To implement this in Python, you can create a function that uses either recursion with memoization or a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to fill a table of values for \( A(n, m) \).

Hereâ€™s a simple outline of how you might implement this:

```python
def eulerian_num(n, m):
    # Create a 2D list to store the Eulerian numbers
    A = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Base cases
    A[0][0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        A[i][0] = 1  # A(n, 0) = 1
        A[i][i] = 0  # A(n, n) = 0
    
    # Fill the table using the recurrence relation
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, i):
            A[i][j] = (i - j) * A[i - 1][j] + (j + 1) * A[i - 1][j - 1]
    
    return A[n][m]

# Example usage
assert eulerian_num(3, 1) == 4
```

This function initializes a table to store the values of the Eulerian numbers and fills it according to the defined recurrence relations. Finally, it returns the value of \( A(n, m) \).


[Critique]
The issue lies in the way the Eulerian numbers are being calculated. The recurrence relation should be carefully checked to ensure it aligns with the mathematical definition. Specifically, the base case for A(n, n) should be set correctly, and the logic in the nested loops should be verified to ensure that the correct values are being computed. Additionally, ensure that the indices used in the array are correctly aligned with the definitions of the Eulerian numbers.


INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/103 [generation text] Explain: The current implementation of the `eulerian_num` function has a mistake in the base case for \( A(n, n) \) and possibly in the recurrence relation. The assertion `assert eulerian_num(3, 1) == 4` is failing because the computed value does not match the expected value. The recurrence relation and the base cases need to be carefully defined to ensure they align with the mathematical definition of Eulerian numbers.

1) Initialize a 2D list `A` to store the Eulerian numbers, with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`.
2) Set the base case \( A(0, 0) = 1 \).
3) For \( n \geq 1 \), set \( A(n, 0) = 1 \) and \( A(n, n) = 0 \).

Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests

assert eulerian_num(3, 1) == 4
"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To find the Eulerian number \( A(n, m) \), which counts the number of permutations of \( n \) elements in which exactly \( m \) elements are greater than the previous element, you can use a recursive approach or dynamic programming.

Conceptually, the Eulerian number can be defined using the following recurrence relations:

1. **Base Cases**:
   - \( A(0, 0) = 1 \) (the empty permutation)
   - \( A(n, 0) = 1 \) for \( n \geq 1 \) (only one way to arrange \( n \) elements with no ascents)
   - \( A(n, n) = 0 \) for \( n \geq 1 \) (no way to arrange \( n \) elements with \( n \) ascents)

2. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - For \( n > 0 \) and \( 0 \leq m < n \):
     \[
     A(n, m) = (n - m) \cdot A(n - 1, m) + (m + 1) \cdot A(n - 1, m - 1)
     \]
   This relation combines the cases based on whether the largest element is at the end of the permutation or not.

To implement this in Python, you can create a function that uses either recursion with memoization or a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to fill a table of values for \( A(n, m) \).

Hereâ€™s a simple outline of how you might implement this:

```python
def eulerian_num(n, m):
    # Create a 2D list to store the Eulerian numbers
    A = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Base cases
    A[0][0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        A[i][0] = 1  # A(n, 0) = 1
        A[i][i] = 0  # A(n, n) = 0
    
    # Fill the table using the recurrence relation
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, i):
            A[i][j] = (i - j) * A[i - 1][j] + (j + 1) * A[i - 1][j - 1]
    
    return A[n][m]

# Example usage
assert eulerian_num(3, 1) == 4
```

This function initializes a table to store the values of the Eulerian numbers and fills it according to the defined recurrence relations. Finally, it returns the value of \( A(n, m) \).


[Critique]
The issue lies in the way the Eulerian numbers are being calculated. The recurrence relation should be carefully checked to ensure it aligns with the mathematical definition. Specifically, the base case for A(n, n) should be set correctly, and the logic in the nested loops should be verified to ensure that the correct values are being computed. Additionally, ensure that the indices used in the array are correctly aligned with the definitions of the Eulerian numbers.


INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/103 [generation text] Explain: The current implementation of the `eulerian_num` function has a mistake in the base case for \( A(n, n) \) and possibly in the recurrence relation. The assertion `assert eulerian_num(3, 1) == 4` is failing because the computed value does not match the expected value. The recurrence relation and the base cases need to be carefully defined to ensure they align with the mathematical definition of Eulerian numbers.

1) Initialize a 2D list `A` to store the Eulerian numbers, with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`.
2) Set the base case \( A(0, 0) = 1 \).
3) For \( n \geq 1 \), set \( A(n, 0) = 1 \) and \( A(n, n) = 0 \).

This function initializes a table to store the values of the Eulerian numbers and fills it according to the defined recurrence relations. Finally, it returns the value of \( A(n, m) \).


[function impl]:


def eulerian_num(n: int, m: int) -> int:
    A = [([0] * (n + 1)) for _ in range((n + 1))]
    A[0][0] = 1
    for i in range(1, (n + 1)):
        A[i][0] = 1
        A[i][i] = 0
    for i in range(1, (n + 1)):
        for j in range(1, i):
            A[i][j] = (((i - j) * A[(i - 1)][j]) + ((j + 1) * A[(i - 1)][(j - 1)]))
    return A[n][m]
