"""
Write a function to compute the sum of digits of each number of a given list.
assert sum_of_digits([10,2,56])==14
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/398 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of computing the sum of digits of each number in a given list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `sum_of_digits` that takes a list of numbers as an argument.

2. **Initialize a Sum Variable**: Inside the function, initialize a variable to keep track of the total sum of digits.

3. **Iterate Over the List**: Use a loop to iterate through each number in the provided list.

4. **Convert Each Number to String**: For each number, convert it to a string to easily access each digit.

5. **Sum the Digits**: For each digit in the string representation of the number, convert it back to an integer and add it to the total sum.

6. **Return the Total Sum**: After processing all numbers in the list, return the total sum of all digits.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def sum_of_digits(numbers):
    total_sum = 0
    for number in numbers:
        for digit in str(number):
            total_sum += int(digit)
    return total_sum

# Example usage
assert sum_of_digits([10, 2, 56]) == 14
```

In this implementation, the function correctly computes the sum of the digits for each number in the list and returns the total. The assertion checks that the function works as expected for the given example.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of computing the sum of digits of each number in a given list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `sum_of_digits` that takes a list of numbers as an argument.

2. **Initialize a Sum Variable**: Inside the function, initialize a variable to keep track of the total sum of digits.

3. **Iterate Over the List**: Use a loop to iterate through each number in the provided list.

4. **Convert Each Number to String**: For each number, convert it to a string to easily access each digit.

5. **Sum the Digits**: For each digit in the string representation of the number, convert it back to an integer and add it to the total sum.

6. **Return the Total Sum**: After processing all numbers in the list, return the total sum of all digits.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def sum_of_digits(numbers):
    total_sum = 0
    for number in numbers:
        for digit in str(number):
            total_sum += int(digit)
    return total_sum

# Example usage
assert sum_of_digits([10, 2, 56]) == 14
```

In this implementation, the function correctly computes the sum of the digits for each number in the list and returns the total. The assertion checks that the function works as expected for the given example.
