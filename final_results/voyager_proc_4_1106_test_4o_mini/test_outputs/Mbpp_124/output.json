    "reasoning": "The implementation failed the test case because the input provided to the function is not in the expected format. The function is designed to take two separate arguments for the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, but the test case is passing a complex number directly (1j) instead of separating the real and imaginary parts. This results in a TypeError, as the function attempts to treat the complex number as a real number.",
    "success": false,
    "critique": "To fix this issue, you should modify the test case to pass the real and imaginary parts separately. For example, instead of using `angle_complex(0, 1j)`, you should use `angle_complex(0, 1)` to represent the complex number 0 + 1j. This change will ensure that the function receives the correct input format."
