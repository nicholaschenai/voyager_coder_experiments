"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/580 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of removing uneven elements from a nested mixed tuple in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `extract_even` that takes a tuple as an argument.

2. **Iterate Through the Tuple**: Use a loop to iterate through each element of the tuple. Since tuples can contain other tuples, you need to check the type of each element.

3. **Check for Even Numbers**: For each element, check if it is an integer and whether it is even (i.e., `element % 2 == 0`). If it is even, you will keep it.

4. **Handle Nested Tuples**: If an element is a tuple, you should recursively call the `extract_even` function on that element to process it further. This way, you can handle any level of nesting.

5. **Build a New Tuple**: Collect all the even elements and the processed nested tuples into a new tuple. You can use a list to gather these elements and then convert it back to a tuple at the end.

6. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the new tuple containing only the even elements and the even elements from nested tuples.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def extract_even(nested_tuple):
    result = []
    for element in nested_tuple:
        if isinstance(element, int):  # Check if the element is an integer
            if element % 2 == 0:  # Check if it is even
                result.append(element)
        elif isinstance(element, tuple):  # Check if the element is a tuple
            even_tuple = extract_even(element)  # Recursively process the nested tuple
            if even_tuple:  # Only add if the result is not empty
                result.append(even_tuple)
    return tuple(result)  # Convert the list back to a tuple
```

This function will effectively remove all odd integers from the nested structure while preserving the even integers and the structure of nested tuples.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
