INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/161 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to remove all elements from a given list present in another list.
assert remove_elements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], [2, 4, 6, 8]) == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/161 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of removing all elements from a given list that are present in another list, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function that takes two parameters: the main list from which elements will be removed and the list of elements to be removed.

2. **Iterate Through the Main List**: Use a loop or a list comprehension to iterate through each element in the main list.

3. **Check for Existence**: For each element in the main list, check if it exists in the list of elements to be removed.

4. **Build a New List**: If an element is not found in the list of elements to be removed, add it to a new list.

5. **Return the New List**: After iterating through all elements, return the new list that contains only the elements that were not removed.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps in Python:

```python
def remove_elements(main_list, remove_list):
    return [item for item in main_list if item not in remove_list]

# Example usage
result = remove_elements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], [2, 4, 6, 8])
print(result)  # Output: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]
```

This function uses a list comprehension for concise and efficient filtering of the main list based on the presence of elements in the remove list.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of removing all elements from a given list that are present in another list, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function that takes two parameters: the main list from which elements will be removed and the list of elements to be removed.

2. **Iterate Through the Main List**: Use a loop or a list comprehension to iterate through each element in the main list.

3. **Check for Existence**: For each element in the main list, check if it exists in the list of elements to be removed.

4. **Build a New List**: If an element is not found in the list of elements to be removed, add it to a new list.

5. **Return the New List**: After iterating through all elements, return the new list that contains only the elements that were not removed.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps in Python:

```python

print(result)  # Output: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]
```

This function uses a list comprehension for concise and efficient filtering of the main list based on the presence of elements in the remove list.

The implementation in the example usage is also correct and follows the plan. However, I need to ensure that the function strictly adheres to the specified function name and typings as mentioned in the task.

Plan:
1) Define the function `remove_elements` that takes two parameters: `main_list` and `remove_list`.
2) Use a list comprehension to iterate through `main_list` and filter out any elements that are present in `remove_list`.
3) Return the new list that contains only the elements from `main_list` that are not in `remove_list`.
