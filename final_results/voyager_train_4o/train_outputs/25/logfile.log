You are a helpful assistant that asks questions to help me decide the next immediate task to do for Python programming.
My ultimate goal is to solve as many diverse problems as possible and become the best programmer in the world.

I will give you the following information:
Completed tasks so far: ...
Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should ask at least 5 questions (but no more than 10 questions) to help me decide the next immediate task to do. Each question should be followed by the concept that the question is about.
2) Your question should be specific to a concept in Python programming.
  Bad example (the question is too general):
    Question: What is the best way to program in Python?
    Concept: unknown
  Good example:
    Question: How do you reverse a list?
    Concept: list
3) Your questions should be self-contained and not require any context.

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:

1) Start your answer with "Answer: ".
2) Answer "Answer: Unknown" if you don't know the answer.

INFO - [Task id] 25 [prompt] Question: How do you implement a simple text-based game using classes in Python?
INFO - [Task id] 25 [generation text] Answer: To implement a simple text-based game using classes in Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Define the Game Structure**: Create classes to represent different components of the game, such as the player, enemies, and the game environment.

2. **Create a Player Class**: This class can hold attributes like health, inventory, and methods for actions like attacking or moving.

3. **Create an Enemy Class**: Similar to the player class, this can have attributes for health and methods for attacking the player.

4. **Create a Game Class**: This class can manage the game loop, handle user input, and control the flow of the game.

5. **Implement Game Logic**: Define how the game progresses, including win/lose conditions, interactions, and events.

Here’s a simple example of a text-based game:

```python
import random

class Player:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.health = 100

    def attack(self, enemy):
        damage = random.randint(5, 20)
        enemy.health -= damage
        print(f"{self.name} attacks {enemy.name} for {damage} damage!")

class Enemy:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.health = 100

    def attack(self, player):
        damage = random.randint(5, 20)
        player.health -= damage
        print(f"{self.name} attacks {player.name} for {damage} damage!")

class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        self.player = Player("Hero")
        self.enemy = Enemy("Goblin")

    def play(self):
        while self.player.health > 0 and self.enemy.health > 0:
            self.player.attack(self.enemy)
            if self.enemy.health > 0:
                self.enemy.attack(self.player)
            print(f"{self.player.name} Health: {self.player.health}, {self.enemy.name} Health: {self.enemy.health}")

        if self.player.health <= 0:
            print("You have been defeated!")
        else:
            print("You defeated the enemy!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    game = Game()
    game.play()
```

In this example:
- The `Player` class has methods to attack an enemy.
- The `Enemy` class has a similar attack method.
- The `Game` class manages the game loop and checks for win/lose conditions.

You can expand this basic structure by adding more features like multiple enemies, different types of attacks, items, and a more complex game world.

Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. As a rule of thumb, guide me through beginner problems, followed by interview level problems, followed by competitive programming problems. The latter 2 levels can involve concepts from data structures and algorithms.
2) Please be very specific about what skills I need to learn.
3) Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for problems which I have not solved yet. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) The task should involve writing a main Python function that at most use basic libraries (try not to import too many or too advanced modules)
7) Do not give tasks that require file operations (create, read, update, delete) or an internet connection.
8) I am only allowed to write Python functions, so do not require me to write other things (e.g. objects). 
9) Requiring me to write a function that takes in an object and uses object methods is still ok, but I cannot define the objects myself. You must provide the objects as input to my function in the assert statement.

Take note of these in your response:
1) Give an expected function name for the task.
2) Give a tuple of 3 assert statements that tests the function's correctness in the "test_tuple" field. This must strictly contain single-line assert statements only; any setup code for the test must be filled in the "test_setup_code" field.
3) The function name which you gave must be called in the assert statements. 

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.

}

INFO - [Task id] 25 [prompt] Question 1: How do you implement a queue using a list in Python?
Answer: You can implement a queue using a list in Python by utilizing the `append()` method to add elements to the end of the list and the `pop(0)` method to remove elements from the front of the list. Here is a simple example:

```python
class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.queue = []

    def enqueue(self, item):
        self.queue.append(item)

    def dequeue(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.queue.pop(0)
        else:
            raise IndexError("dequeue from an empty queue")

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.queue) == 0

    def size(self):
        return len(self.queue)

# Example usage:
q = Queue()
q.enqueue(1)
q.enqueue(2)
q.enqueue(3)
print(q.dequeue())  # Output: 1
print(q.size())     # Output: 2
```

In this implementation:
- `enqueue` adds an item to the end of the queue.
- `dequeue` removes and returns the item from the front of the queue.
- `is_empty` checks if the queue is empty.
- `size` returns the number of items in the queue. 

Keep in mind that using a list for a queue can be inefficient for large queues because `pop(0)` has a time complexity of O(n). For better performance, consider using `collections.deque`, which is optimized for fast appends and pops from both ends.

Question 2: How do you implement a binary search algorithm in Python?
Answer: To implement a binary search algorithm in Python, you can use either an iterative or a recursive approach. Below are examples of both methods.

### Iterative Approach

```python
def binary_search_iterative(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To prevent overflow
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Target found
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1  # Search in the right half
        else:
            right = mid - 1  # Search in the left half
            
    return -1  # Target not found
```

### Recursive Approach

```python
def binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, right):
    if left > right:
        return -1  # Target not found
    
    mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To prevent overflow
    
    if arr[mid] == target:
        return mid  # Target found
    elif arr[mid] < target:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, mid + 1, right)  # Search in the right half
    else:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, mid - 1)  # Search in the left half

# To use the recursive function, call it like this:
# result = binary_search_recursive(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
```

### Usage Example

```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
target = 5

# Using iterative approach
result_iterative = binary_search_iterative(arr, target)
print("Iterative result:", result_iterative)

# Using recursive approach
result_recursive = binary_search_recursive(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
print("Recursive result:", result_recursive)
```

### Note
- The array must be sorted for binary search to work correctly.
- The function returns the index of the target if found, or -1 if the target is not in the array.

Question 3: What is the best way to merge two sorted lists into a single sorted list?
Answer: The best way to merge two sorted lists into a single sorted list is to use a two-pointer technique. This method involves iterating through both lists simultaneously and comparing the elements at the current pointers. Here’s a simple implementation in Python:

```python
def merge_sorted_lists(list1, list2):
    merged_list = []
    i, j = 0, 0

    while i < len(list1) and j < len(list2):
        if list1[i] < list2[j]:
            merged_list.append(list1[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            merged_list.append(list2[j])
            j += 1

    # Append any remaining elements from list1
    while i < len(list1):
        merged_list.append(list1[i])
        i += 1

    # Append any remaining elements from list2
    while j < len(list2):
        merged_list.append(list2[j])
        j += 1

    return merged_list

# Example usage:
list1 = [1, 3, 5]
list2 = [2, 4, 6]
result = merge_sorted_lists(list1, list2)
print(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

This approach efficiently merges the two lists in O(n + m) time complexity, where n and m are the lengths of the two lists.

Question 4: What is the difference between deep copy and shallow copy in Python?
Answer: In Python, the difference between deep copy and shallow copy lies in how they handle the copying of objects and their nested objects.

- **Shallow Copy**: A shallow copy creates a new object, but it does not create copies of nested objects. Instead, it copies references to the original nested objects. This means that if you modify a nested object in the shallow copy, the change will also reflect in the original object because both the original and the shallow copy refer to the same nested object.

  You can create a shallow copy using the `copy` module's `copy()` function or by using the `list()` constructor for lists.

  Example:
  ```python
  import copy

  original = [1, 2, [3, 4]]
  shallow_copied = copy.copy(original)

  shallow_copied[2][0] = 'changed'
  print(original)  # Output: [1, 2, ['changed', 4]]
  ```

- **Deep Copy**: A deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all nested objects, creating entirely independent copies. This means that changes made to the deep copy will not affect the original object or its nested objects.

  You can create a deep copy using the `copy` module's `deepcopy()` function.

  Example:
  ```python
  import copy

  original = [1, 2, [3, 4]]
  deep_copied = copy.deepcopy(original)

  deep_copied[2][0] = 'changed'
  print(original)  # Output: [1, 2, [3, 4]]
  ```

In summary, use shallow copy when you want to copy an object but share nested objects, and use deep copy when you want to create a completely independent copy of an object and all its nested objects.

Question 5: How do you implement a simple text-based game using classes in Python?
Answer: To implement a simple text-based game using classes in Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Define the Game Structure**: Create classes to represent different components of the game, such as the player, enemies, and the game environment.

2. **Create a Player Class**: This class can hold attributes like health, inventory, and methods for actions like attacking or moving.

3. **Create an Enemy Class**: Similar to the player class, this can have attributes for health and methods for attacking the player.

4. **Create a Game Class**: This class can manage the game loop, handle user input, and control the flow of the game.

5. **Implement Game Logic**: Define how the game progresses, including win/lose conditions, interactions, and events.

Here’s a simple example of a text-based game:

```python
import random

class Player:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.health = 100

    def attack(self, enemy):
        damage = random.randint(5, 20)
        enemy.health -= damage
        print(f"{self.name} attacks {enemy.name} for {damage} damage!")

class Enemy:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.health = 100

    def attack(self, player):
        damage = random.randint(5, 20)
        player.health -= damage
        print(f"{self.name} attacks {player.name} for {damage} damage!")

class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        self.player = Player("Hero")
        self.enemy = Enemy("Goblin")

    def play(self):
        while self.player.health > 0 and self.enemy.health > 0:
            self.player.attack(self.enemy)
            if self.enemy.health > 0:
                self.enemy.attack(self.player)
            print(f"{self.player.name} Health: {self.player.health}, {self.enemy.name} Health: {self.enemy.health}")

        if self.player.health <= 0:
            print("You have been defeated!")
        else:
            print("You defeated the enemy!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    game = Game()
    game.play()
```

In this example:
- The `Player` class has methods to attack an enemy.
- The `Enemy` class has a similar attack method.
- The `Game` class manages the game loop and checks for win/lose conditions.

You can expand this basic structure by adding more features like multiple enemies, different types of attacks, items, and a more complex game world.

	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a list of all unique pairs (as tuples) that sum up to a given target integer. The pairs should be sorted in ascending order, and each pair should be sorted as well.
	Write a Python function that takes a string and returns the longest substring without repeating characters.
	Write a Python function that takes two lists of integers and returns a list of their common elements. The result should not contain duplicates and should be sorted in ascending order.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and sorts it in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm. The function should return the sorted list.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numbers in the list. Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.
	Write a Python function that takes a string and returns a new string with all the vowels removed. The function should be case-insensitive, meaning it should remove both uppercase and lowercase vowels.
	Write a Python function that takes two lists of integers and returns a list of integers that are present in both lists, without duplicates. Use set operations to achieve this.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of operations (as strings) and simulates a stack using a list. The operations can be 'push X' to push an integer X onto the stack, 'pop' to remove the top element, and 'peek' to return the top element without removing it. The function should return a list of results from the 'pop' and 'peek' operations.
	Write a Python function that takes two lists of integers and returns a list of integers that are present in either of the lists but not in both. The result should not contain duplicates and should be sorted in ascending order.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a dictionary where the keys are the integers and the values are the number of times each integer appears in the list. This will help practice using dictionaries for counting occurrences.
	Write a Python function that takes an integer n and returns a list of all prime numbers less than n. This will help you practice loops, conditionals, and understanding of prime numbers.
	Write a Python function that takes a string and a pattern (both strings) and returns True if the pattern is found in the string, and False otherwise. The function should perform a simple substring search.
	Write a Python function that calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer using recursion. The function should return the factorial value.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the index of the first occurrence of the maximum value in the list. If the list is empty, return -1.

	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the list sorted in ascending order using the quicksort algorithm. This will help you practice implementing a classic sorting algorithm and understanding its recursive nature.
	Write a Python function that takes a string and returns True if the string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization. Otherwise, return False.

Failed tasks that are too hard: 
	Write a Python function that implements a queue using a list. The function should support enqueue (add an item to the end of the queue), dequeue (remove an item from the front of the queue), and is_empty (check if the queue is empty) operations. The function should return a tuple of results from these operations for testing purposes.
	Write a Python function that simulates a stack using a list. The function should support 'push' (add an item to the top of the stack), 'pop' (remove the item from the top of the stack), and 'peek' (return the item at the top of the stack without removing it) operations. The function should return a list of results from the 'pop' and 'peek' operations for testing purposes.

Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a list of integers that appear only once in the original list. The result should be sorted in ascending order.
INFO - [Task id] 25 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of creating a Python function that returns a list of integers appearing only once in the original list and sorts them in ascending order, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Count Occurrences**: Use a data structure to count how many times each integer appears in the list. A common choice for this is a dictionary or the `collections.Counter` class, which simplifies counting elements.

2. **Filter Unique Integers**: After counting, iterate through the counted items and select only those integers that have a count of one, indicating they appear only once in the original list.

3. **Sort the Result**: Once you have the list of unique integers, sort this list in ascending order.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the sorted list of unique integers.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

The main function is `unique_elements`.
INFO - [Task id] 25 [generation text] This function takes a list as input and counts the occurrences of each element using the Counter class. It then creates a new list containing only the elements that appear exactly once in the input list. After filtering, the unique elements are sorted in ascending order. Finally, the function returns the sorted list of unique integers.
