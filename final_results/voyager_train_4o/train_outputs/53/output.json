    "reasoning": "The function implementation correctly performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a graph represented as an adjacency list. It uses a recursive helper function to traverse the graph, marking nodes as visited and adding them to the result list in the order they are visited. The unit tests confirm that the function returns the expected order of nodes for different starting points, indicating that the function meets the task requirements.",
