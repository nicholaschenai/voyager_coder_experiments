    Concept: unknown
  Good example:
    Question: How do you reverse a list?
    Concept: list
3) Your questions should be self-contained and not require any context.

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Question: ...

You will answer the question based on the context (only if available and helpful) and your own knowledge of Python programming.
1) Start your answer with "Answer: ".
2) Answer "Answer: Unknown" if you don't know the answer.

INFO - [Task id] 27 [prompt] Question: How can you use list comprehensions to create a new list from an existing one?
INFO - [Task id] 27 [generation text] Answer: You can use list comprehensions in Python to create a new list by applying an expression to each item in an existing iterable (like a list) and optionally filtering items based on a condition. The syntax for a list comprehension is:

```python
new_list = [expression for item in existing_list if condition]
```

Here’s a simple example:

```python
# Existing list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Create a new list with squares of the numbers
squared_numbers = [x**2 for x in numbers]

print(squared_numbers)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

In this example, `x**2` is the expression applied to each item in `numbers`, and the result is stored in `squared_numbers`. You can also include a condition to filter items:

```python
# Create a new list with squares of even numbers only
squared_even_numbers = [x**2 for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]

print(squared_even_numbers)  # Output: [4, 16]
```

In this case, only even numbers from the original list are squared and included in the new list.

Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. As a rule of thumb, guide me through beginner problems, followed by interview level problems, followed by competitive programming problems. The latter 2 levels can involve concepts from data structures and algorithms.
2) Please be very specific about what skills I need to learn.
3) Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for problems which I have not solved yet. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) The task should involve writing a main Python function that at most use basic libraries (try not to import too many or too advanced modules)
7) Do not give tasks that require file operations (create, read, update, delete) or an internet connection.
8) I am only allowed to write Python functions, so do not require me to write other things (e.g. objects). 
9) Requiring me to write a function that takes in an object and uses object methods is still ok, but I cannot define the objects myself. You must provide the objects as input to my function in the assert statement.

Take note of these in your response:
1) Give an expected function name for the task.
2) Give a tuple of 3 assert statements that tests the function's correctness in the "test_tuple" field. This must strictly contain single-line assert statements only; any setup code for the test must be filled in the "test_setup_code" field.
3) The function name which you gave must be called in the assert statements. 

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}

INFO - [Task id] 27 [prompt] Question 1: How do you implement a binary search algorithm in Python?
Answer: To implement a binary search algorithm in Python, you can use either an iterative or a recursive approach. Below are examples of both methods.

### Iterative Approach

```python
def binary_search_iterative(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To prevent overflow
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Target found
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1  # Search in the right half
        else:
            right = mid - 1  # Search in the left half
            
    return -1  # Target not found
```

### Recursive Approach

```python
def binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, right):
    if left > right:
        return -1  # Target not found
    
    mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To prevent overflow
    
    if arr[mid] == target:
        return mid  # Target found
    elif arr[mid] < target:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, mid + 1, right)  # Search in the right half
    else:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, mid - 1)  # Search in the left half

# To use the recursive function, call it like this:
# result = binary_search_recursive(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
```

### Usage Example

```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
target = 5

# Using iterative approach
result_iterative = binary_search_iterative(arr, target)
print("Iterative result:", result_iterative)

# Using recursive approach
result_recursive = binary_search_recursive(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
print("Recursive result:", result_recursive)
```

### Note
- The array must be sorted for binary search to work correctly.
- The function returns the index of the target if found, or -1 if the target is not in the array.

Question 2: What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?
Answer: The main differences between a list and a tuple in Python are:

1. **Mutability**: Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their content (add, remove, or modify elements) after they are created. Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable, which means once a tuple is created, you cannot change its content.

2. **Syntax**: Lists are defined using square brackets `[]`, while tuples are defined using parentheses `()`.

3. **Performance**: Tuples can be slightly more memory-efficient and faster than lists for certain operations because of their immutability.

4. **Use Cases**: Lists are generally used for collections of items that may need to be modified, while tuples are often used for fixed collections of items, such as coordinates or records, where the data should not change.

Example:
```python
# List
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)  # This is allowed

# Tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
# my_tuple.append(4)  # This would raise an AttributeError
```

In summary, choose lists when you need a mutable sequence and tuples when you need an immutable sequence.

Question 3: How can you use list comprehensions to create a new list from an existing one?
Answer: You can use list comprehensions in Python to create a new list by applying an expression to each item in an existing iterable (like a list) and optionally filtering items based on a condition. The syntax for a list comprehension is:

```python
new_list = [expression for item in existing_list if condition]
```

Here’s a simple example:

```python
# Existing list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Create a new list with squares of the numbers
squared_numbers = [x**2 for x in numbers]

print(squared_numbers)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

In this example, `x**2` is the expression applied to each item in `numbers`, and the result is stored in `squared_numbers`. You can also include a condition to filter items:

```python
# Create a new list with squares of even numbers only
squared_even_numbers = [x**2 for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]

print(squared_even_numbers)  # Output: [4, 16]
```

In this case, only even numbers from the original list are squared and included in the new list.

Question 4: What are decorators in Python and how do you use them?
Answer: Decorators in Python are a powerful and flexible way to modify or enhance the behavior of functions or methods. They allow you to wrap another function, adding functionality before or after the wrapped function runs, without modifying its code directly.

A decorator is typically defined as a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a new function that usually extends or alters the behavior of the original function.

Here's a simple example of how to create and use a decorator:

1. **Define a decorator**:
```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper
```

2. **Use the decorator**:
You can apply the decorator to a function using the `@decorator_name` syntax.

```python
@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

# Call the decorated function
say_hello()
```

When you call `say_hello()`, the output will be:
```
Something is happening before the function is called.
Hello!
Something is happening after the function is called.
```

In this example, `my_decorator` is a decorator that adds behavior before and after the `say_hello` function is executed.

Decorators can also take arguments, and they can be stacked (multiple decorators can be applied to a single function). They are commonly used in Python for logging, enforcing access control, instrumentation, and caching, among other use cases.

Question 5: How can you handle exceptions in Python using try and except?
Answer: In Python, you can handle exceptions using the `try` and `except` blocks. The code that might raise an exception is placed inside the `try` block, and the code that handles the exception is placed inside the `except` block. Here’s a basic example:

```python
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
    result = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
except ZeroDivisionError:
    # Code that runs if a ZeroDivisionError occurs
    print("You cannot divide by zero!")
except Exception as e:
    # Code that runs for any other exception
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
else:
    # Code that runs if no exception occurs
    print(f"The result is {result}")
finally:
    # Code that runs no matter what (optional)
    print("Execution completed.")
```

In this example:
- The `try` block contains code that may raise an exception.
- The `except` block catches specific exceptions (like `ZeroDivisionError`) and handles them.
- The `else` block runs if no exceptions were raised in the `try` block.
- The `finally` block runs regardless of whether an exception occurred or not, which is useful for cleanup actions.

You are a helpful assistant that tells me the next immediate task (in the form of a function) to do for Python programming.

Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. As a rule of thumb, guide me through beginner problems, followed by interview level problems, followed by competitive programming problems. The latter 2 levels can involve concepts from data structures and algorithms.
2) Please be very specific about what skills I need to learn.
3) Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for problems which I have not solved yet. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) The task should involve writing a main Python function that at most use basic libraries (try not to import too many or too advanced modules)
7) Do not give tasks that require file operations (create, read, update, delete) or an internet connection.
8) I am only allowed to write Python functions, so do not require me to write other things (e.g. objects). 
9) Requiring me to write a function that takes in an object and uses object methods is still ok, but I cannot define the objects myself. You must provide the objects as input to my function in the assert statement.

Take note of these in your response:
1) Give an expected function name for the task.
2) Give a tuple of 3 assert statements that tests the function's correctness in the "test_tuple" field. This must strictly contain single-line assert statements only; any setup code for the test must be filled in the "test_setup_code" field.
3) The function name which you gave must be called in the assert statements. 

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

INFO - [Task id] 27 [prompt] Question 1: How do you implement a binary search algorithm in Python?
Answer: To implement a binary search algorithm in Python, you can use either an iterative or a recursive approach. Below are examples of both methods.

### Iterative Approach

```python
def binary_search_iterative(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To prevent overflow
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Target found
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1  # Search in the right half
        else:
            right = mid - 1  # Search in the left half
            
    return -1  # Target not found
```

### Recursive Approach

```python
def binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, right):
    if left > right:
        return -1  # Target not found
    
    mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To prevent overflow
    
    if arr[mid] == target:
        return mid  # Target found
    elif arr[mid] < target:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, mid + 1, right)  # Search in the right half
    else:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, mid - 1)  # Search in the left half

# To use the recursive function, call it like this:
# result = binary_search_recursive(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
```

### Usage Example

```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
target = 5

# Using iterative approach
result_iterative = binary_search_iterative(arr, target)
print("Iterative result:", result_iterative)

# Using recursive approach
result_recursive = binary_search_recursive(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
print("Recursive result:", result_recursive)
```

### Note
- The array must be sorted for binary search to work correctly.
- The function returns the index of the target if found, or -1 if the target is not in the array.

Question 2: What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?
Answer: The main differences between a list and a tuple in Python are:

1. **Mutability**: Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their content (add, remove, or modify elements) after they are created. Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable, which means once a tuple is created, you cannot change its content.

2. **Syntax**: Lists are defined using square brackets `[]`, while tuples are defined using parentheses `()`.

3. **Performance**: Tuples can be slightly more memory-efficient and faster than lists for certain operations because of their immutability.

4. **Use Cases**: Lists are generally used for collections of items that may need to be modified, while tuples are often used for fixed collections of items, such as coordinates or records, where the data should not change.

Example:
```python
# List
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)  # This is allowed

# Tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
# my_tuple.append(4)  # This would raise an AttributeError
```

In summary, choose lists when you need a mutable sequence and tuples when you need an immutable sequence.

Question 3: How can you use list comprehensions to create a new list from an existing one?
Answer: You can use list comprehensions in Python to create a new list by applying an expression to each item in an existing iterable (like a list) and optionally filtering items based on a condition. The syntax for a list comprehension is:

```python
new_list = [expression for item in existing_list if condition]
```

Here’s a simple example:

```python
# Existing list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Create a new list with squares of the numbers
squared_numbers = [x**2 for x in numbers]

print(squared_numbers)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

In this example, `x**2` is the expression applied to each item in `numbers`, and the result is stored in `squared_numbers`. You can also include a condition to filter items:

```python
# Create a new list with squares of even numbers only
squared_even_numbers = [x**2 for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]

print(squared_even_numbers)  # Output: [4, 16]
```

In this case, only even numbers from the original list are squared and included in the new list.

Question 4: What are decorators in Python and how do you use them?
Answer: Decorators in Python are a powerful and flexible way to modify or enhance the behavior of functions or methods. They allow you to wrap another function, adding functionality before or after the wrapped function runs, without modifying its code directly.

A decorator is typically defined as a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a new function that usually extends or alters the behavior of the original function.

Here's a simple example of how to create and use a decorator:

1. **Define a decorator**:
```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper
```

2. **Use the decorator**:
You can apply the decorator to a function using the `@decorator_name` syntax.

```python
@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

# Call the decorated function
say_hello()
```

When you call `say_hello()`, the output will be:
```
Something is happening before the function is called.
Hello!
Something is happening after the function is called.
```

In this example, `my_decorator` is a decorator that adds behavior before and after the `say_hello` function is executed.

Decorators can also take arguments, and they can be stacked (multiple decorators can be applied to a single function). They are commonly used in Python for logging, enforcing access control, instrumentation, and caching, among other use cases.

Question 5: How can you handle exceptions in Python using try and except?
Answer: In Python, you can handle exceptions using the `try` and `except` blocks. The code that might raise an exception is placed inside the `try` block, and the code that handles the exception is placed inside the `except` block. Here’s a basic example:

```python
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
    result = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
except ZeroDivisionError:
    # Code that runs if a ZeroDivisionError occurs
    print("You cannot divide by zero!")
except Exception as e:
    # Code that runs for any other exception
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
else:
    # Code that runs if no exception occurs
    print(f"The result is {result}")
finally:
    # Code that runs no matter what (optional)
    print("Execution completed.")
```

In this example:
- The `try` block contains code that may raise an exception.
- The `except` block catches specific exceptions (like `ZeroDivisionError`) and handles them.
- The `else` block runs if no exceptions were raised in the `try` block.
- The `finally` block runs regardless of whether an exception occurred or not, which is useful for cleanup actions.

Completed tasks so far (do not give me these tasks again!): 
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of strings and returns a dictionary where the keys are the strings and the values are the number of times each string appears in the list.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of strings and returns a dictionary where the keys are the lengths of the strings and the values are lists of strings of that length.
	Write a Python function that takes a string and returns the first non-repeating character in it. If all characters repeat, return None.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a list of all unique pairs (as tuples) that sum up to a given target integer. The pairs should be sorted in ascending order, and each pair should be sorted as well.
	Write a Python function that takes a string and returns the longest substring without repeating characters.
	Write a Python function that takes two lists of integers and returns a list of their common elements. The result should not contain duplicates and should be sorted in ascending order.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and sorts it in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm. The function should return the sorted list.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numbers in the list. Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.
	Write a Python function that takes a string and returns a new string with all the vowels removed. The function should be case-insensitive, meaning it should remove both uppercase and lowercase vowels.
	Write a Python function that takes two lists of integers and returns a list of integers that are present in both lists, without duplicates. Use set operations to achieve this.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of operations (as strings) and simulates a stack using a list. The operations can be 'push X' to push an integer X onto the stack, 'pop' to remove the top element, and 'peek' to return the top element without removing it. The function should return a list of results from the 'pop' and 'peek' operations.
	Write a Python function that takes two lists of integers and returns a list of integers that are present in either of the lists but not in both. The result should not contain duplicates and should be sorted in ascending order.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a dictionary where the keys are the integers and the values are the number of times each integer appears in the list. This will help practice using dictionaries for counting occurrences.
	Write a Python function that takes an integer n and returns a list of all prime numbers less than n. This will help you practice loops, conditionals, and understanding of prime numbers.
	Write a Python function that takes a string and a pattern (both strings) and returns True if the pattern is found in the string, and False otherwise. The function should perform a simple substring search.
	Write a Python function that calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer using recursion. The function should return the factorial value.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the index of the first occurrence of the maximum value in the list. If the list is empty, return -1.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a list of the k largest elements in descending order. Use a min-heap to efficiently find the k largest elements.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a list of all integers that appear more than once in the list. The result should not contain duplicates and should be sorted in ascending order.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the list sorted in ascending order using the quicksort algorithm. This will help you practice implementing a classic sorting algorithm and understanding its recursive nature.
	Write a Python function that takes a string and returns True if the string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization. Otherwise, return False.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a list of integers that appear only once in the original list. The result should be sorted in ascending order.
	Write a Python function that takes a string and a list of words, and returns a list of words from the list that are substrings of the given string. This will help practice string manipulation and searching techniques.

Failed tasks that are too hard: 
	Write a Python function that implements a queue using a list. The function should support enqueue (add an item to the end of the queue), dequeue (remove an item from the front of the queue), and is_empty (check if the queue is empty) operations. The function should return a tuple of results from these operations for testing purposes.
	Write a Python function that simulates a stack using a list. The function should support 'push' (add an item to the top of the stack), 'pop' (remove the item from the top of the stack), and 'peek' (return the item at the top of the stack without removing it) operations. The function should return a list of results from the 'pop' and 'peek' operations for testing purposes.

INFO - [Task id] 27 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a list of integers that appear more than once in the list. The result should not contain duplicates and should be sorted in ascending order.
INFO - [Task id] 27 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding integers that appear more than once in a list and returning them in a sorted order without duplicates, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Count Occurrences**: Use a data structure to count how many times each integer appears in the list. A dictionary or the `collections.Counter` class can be useful for this purpose.

2. **Filter Duplicates**: After counting, filter the integers to keep only those that have a count greater than one, indicating they appear more than once.

3. **Remove Duplicates**: Since you only want unique integers in the result, you can use a set to store these integers.

4. **Sort the Result**: Finally, convert the set back to a list and sort it in ascending order.

Here’s a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def find_duplicates(input_list):
    from collections import Counter
    
    # Step 1: Count occurrences
    counts = Counter(input_list)
    
    # Step 2: Filter for duplicates
    duplicates = {num for num, count in counts.items() if count > 1}
    
    # Step 3: Sort the result
    return sorted(duplicates)
```

This function will take a list of integers, count their occurrences, filter out the duplicates, and return a sorted list of those integers that appear more than once.

[Task]
Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a list of integers that appear more than once in the list. The result should not contain duplicates and should be sorted in ascending order.
You must strictly follow the function name: find_duplicates

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding integers that appear more than once in a list and returning them in a sorted order without duplicates, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Count Occurrences**: Use a data structure to count how many times each integer appears in the list. A dictionary or the `collections.Counter` class can be useful for this purpose.

2. **Filter Duplicates**: After counting, filter the integers to keep only those that have a count greater than one, indicating they appear more than once.

3. **Remove Duplicates**: Since you only want unique integers in the result, you can use a set to store these integers.

4. **Sort the Result**: Finally, convert the set back to a list and sort it in ascending order.

Here’s a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def find_duplicates(input_list):
    from collections import Counter
    
    # Step 1: Count occurrences
    counts = Counter(input_list)
    
    # Step 2: Filter for duplicates
    duplicates = {num for num, count in counts.items() if count > 1}
    
    # Step 3: Sort the result
    return sorted(duplicates)
```

This function will take a list of integers, count their occurrences, filter out the duplicates, and return a sorted list of those integers that appear more than once.

You are a Python programming assistant that assesses my progress of Python programming and provides useful guidance.

I will give you the following information:

[Task]: The objective I need to accomplish.
[Context]: The context of the task. Serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help me on the task, but my priority is to follow instructions in the Task tag.
[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

You should only respond in JSON format as described below:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

To overcome this error, we should change the condition to only update the result when the current subarray length is strictly greater than the previous longest subarray length.
