    "reasoning": "The implementation of the depth-first search (DFS) function is incorrect because it sorts the neighbors before adding them to the stack. This sorting changes the order in which nodes are visited, which is not a characteristic of DFS. DFS should visit nodes in the order they are encountered, without any sorting. The test cases fail because the order of visited nodes does not match the expected DFS order due to this sorting step.",

    "critique": "To fix the implementation, remove the sorting of neighbors before adding them to the stack. This will ensure that nodes are visited in the natural order of DFS, which is determined by the order of neighbors in the adjacency list. Simply extend the stack with the neighbors as they are encountered, without sorting."
