    "reasoning": "The function implementation correctly follows the task requirements by iterating through integers, calculating their squares, and appending them to a list if they are less than the given integer n. The loop stops when the square is no longer less than n, ensuring that only valid perfect squares are included. The unit tests confirm that the function behaves as expected for various inputs, including edge cases.",
