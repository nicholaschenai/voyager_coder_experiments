    "reasoning": "The function implementation correctly follows the binary search algorithm. It initializes the left and right pointers, calculates the midpoint, and adjusts the pointers based on the comparison between the midpoint value and the target. The function returns the correct index if the target is found and -1 if it is not present in the list. All provided test cases pass, indicating that the function works as expected for the given scenarios.",
