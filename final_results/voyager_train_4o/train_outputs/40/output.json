    "reasoning": "The function implementation correctly uses a stack-based approach to find the next greater element for each element in the list. It initializes a result list with -1, iterates through the list, and uses a stack to track indices of elements for which the next greater element is yet to be found. The function updates the result list with the next greater element when found and handles cases where no greater element exists by leaving -1 in the result list. All provided test cases pass, indicating the function meets the task requirements.",
