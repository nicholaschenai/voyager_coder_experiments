    Concept: unknown
  Good example:
    Question: How do you reverse a list?
    Concept: list
3) Your questions should be self-contained and not require any context.

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}

INFO - [Task id] 67 [prompt] Question: What is the best way to find the longest common subsequence between two strings?
INFO - [Task id] 67 [generation text] Answer: The best way to find the longest common subsequence (LCS) between two strings is to use dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array (or table) where the cell at position (i, j) represents the length of the LCS of the substrings formed by the first i characters of the first string and the first j characters of the second string.

Here’s a step-by-step outline of the algorithm:

1. **Initialize a 2D array**: Create a 2D array `dp` of size (m+1) x (n+1), where m and n are the lengths of the two strings. Initialize all elements to 0.

2. **Fill the array**: Iterate through each character of both strings. If the characters match, set `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`. If they do not match, set `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.

3. **Backtrack to find the LCS**: After filling the table, the length of the LCS will be in `dp[m][n]`. To find the actual LCS, backtrack from `dp[m][n]` to reconstruct the sequence.

Here is a sample implementation in Python:

```python
def longest_common_subsequence(str1, str2):
    m, n = len(str1), len(str2)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]

    # Fill the dp array
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])

    # Backtrack to find the LCS
    lcs_length = dp[m][n]
    lcs = []
    while m > 0 and n > 0:
        if str1[m - 1] == str2[n - 1]:
            lcs.append(str1[m - 1])
            m -= 1
            n -= 1
        elif dp[m - 1][n] > dp[m][n - 1]:
            m -= 1
        else:
            n -= 1

    lcs.reverse()  # The LCS is built backwards
    return ''.join(lcs)

# Example usage
str1 = "AGGTAB"
str2 = "GXTXAYB"
print(longest_common_subsequence(str1, str2))  # Output: "GTAB"
```

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(m * n) and a space complexity of O(m * n), making it efficient for reasonably sized strings.

Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. As a rule of thumb, guide me through beginner problems, followed by interview level problems, followed by competitive programming problems. The latter 2 levels can involve concepts from data structures and algorithms.
2) Please be very specific about what skills I need to learn.
3) Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for problems which I have not solved yet. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) The task should involve writing a main Python function that at most use basic libraries (try not to import too many or too advanced modules)
7) Do not give tasks that require file operations (create, read, update, delete) or an internet connection.
8) I am only allowed to write Python functions, so do not require me to write other things (e.g. objects). 
9) Requiring me to write a function that takes in an object and uses object methods is still ok, but I cannot define the objects myself. You must provide the objects as input to my function in the assert statement.

Take note of these in your response:
1) Give an expected function name for the task.
2) Give a tuple of 3 assert statements that tests the function's correctness in the "test_tuple" field. This must strictly contain single-line assert statements only; any setup code for the test must be filled in the "test_setup_code" field.
3) The function name which you gave must be called in the assert statements.

INFO - [Task id] 67 [prompt] Question 1: How do you perform a binary search on a sorted list?
Answer: To perform a binary search on a sorted list in Python, you can use the following steps:

1. Initialize two pointers, `low` and `high`, to the start and end of the list, respectively.
2. While `low` is less than or equal to `high`, calculate the middle index `mid` as the average of `low` and `high`.
3. Compare the middle element with the target value:
   - If the middle element is equal to the target, return the index `mid`.
   - If the middle element is less than the target, move the `low` pointer to `mid + 1`.
   - If the middle element is greater than the target, move the `high` pointer to `mid - 1`.
4. If the target is not found, return an indication that the target is not in the list (e.g., return -1).

Here is a sample implementation in Python:

```python
def binary_search(sorted_list, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(sorted_list) - 1

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if sorted_list[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif sorted_list[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1

    return -1  # Target not found
```

You can call this function with a sorted list and the target value you want to search for.

Question 2: What is the best way to find the longest common subsequence between two strings?
Answer: The best way to find the longest common subsequence (LCS) between two strings is to use dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array (or table) where the cell at position (i, j) represents the length of the LCS of the substrings formed by the first i characters of the first string and the first j characters of the second string.

Here’s a step-by-step outline of the algorithm:

1. **Initialize a 2D array**: Create a 2D array `dp` of size (m+1) x (n+1), where m and n are the lengths of the two strings. Initialize all elements to 0.

2. **Fill the array**: Iterate through each character of both strings. If the characters match, set `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`. If they do not match, set `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.

3. **Backtrack to find the LCS**: After filling the table, the length of the LCS will be in `dp[m][n]`. To find the actual LCS, backtrack from `dp[m][n]` to reconstruct the sequence.

Here is a sample implementation in Python:

    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]

    # Fill the dp array
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])

    # Backtrack to find the LCS
    lcs_length = dp[m][n]
    lcs = []
    while m > 0 and n > 0:
        if str1[m - 1] == str2[n - 1]:
            lcs.append(str1[m - 1])
            m -= 1
            n -= 1
        elif dp[m - 1][n] > dp[m][n - 1]:
            m -= 1
        else:
            n -= 1

    lcs.reverse()  # The LCS is built backwards
    return ''.join(lcs)

# Example usage
str1 = "AGGTAB"
str2 = "GXTXAYB"
print(longest_common_subsequence(str1, str2))  # Output: "GTAB"
```

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(m * n) and a space complexity of O(m * n), making it efficient for reasonably sized strings.

Question 3: How do you implement a breadth-first search (BFS) on a binary tree?
Answer: To implement a breadth-first search (BFS) on a binary tree, you can use a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes to be explored. Here’s a step-by-step approach along with a sample implementation in Python:

1. **Initialize a queue**: Start by adding the root node of the binary tree to the queue.
2. **Iterate while the queue is not empty**: Dequeue a node from the front of the queue, process it (e.g., print its value), and then enqueue its left and right children (if they exist).
3. **Continue until the queue is empty**: This ensures that all nodes at the current level are processed before moving to the next level.

Here’s a sample implementation:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def bfs(root):
    if not root:
        return
    
    queue = [root]  # Initialize the queue with the root node
    
    while queue:
        current = queue.pop(0)  # Dequeue the front node
        print(current.value)     # Process the current node
        
        # Enqueue left child if it exists
        if current.left:
            queue.append(current.left)
        
        # Enqueue right child if it exists
        if current.right:
            queue.append(current.right)

# Example usage:
# Constructing a simple binary tree
#         1
#        / \
#       2   3
#      / \
#     4   5

root = TreeNode(1)
root.left = TreeNode(2)
root.right = TreeNode(3)
root.left.left = TreeNode(4)
root.left.right = TreeNode(5)

bfs(root)  # Output: 1 2 3 4 5
```

In this implementation, the `bfs` function performs a breadth-first traversal of the binary tree, printing the values of the nodes in the order they are visited.

Question 4: What is the best way to find the maximum product of any two integers in a list?
Answer: The best way to find the maximum product of any two integers in a list is to first identify the two largest integers in the list. You can do this efficiently in a single pass through the list. Here’s a simple approach:

1. Initialize two variables, `max1` and `max2`, to hold the largest and second largest integers, respectively.
2. Iterate through the list, updating `max1` and `max2` as you find larger integers.
3. The maximum product will be the product of `max1` and `max2`.

Here’s a sample implementation in Python:

```python
def max_product(nums):
    if len(nums) < 2:
        raise ValueError("At least two numbers are required")
    
    max1 = max2 = float('-inf')
    
    for num in nums:
        if num > max1:
            max2 = max1
            max1 = num
        elif num > max2:
            max2 = num
            
    return max1 * max2

# Example usage:
numbers = [3, 5, 1, 2, 4]
result = max_product(numbers)
print(result)  # Output: 20 (5 * 4)
```

This method runs in O(n) time complexity, making it efficient for large lists.

Question 5: How do you calculate the sum of all integers that are multiples of a given number in a list?
Answer: To calculate the sum of all integers that are multiples of a given number in a list, you can use a simple loop or a list comprehension in Python. Here’s an example using both methods:

### Using a loop:
```python
def sum_of_multiples(numbers, multiple):
    total = 0
    for number in numbers:
        if number % multiple == 0:
            total += number
    return total

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
multiple = 2
result = sum_of_multiples(numbers, multiple)
print(result)  # Output: 30 (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10)
```

### Using a list comprehension:
```python
def sum_of_multiples(numbers, multiple):
    return sum(number for number in numbers if number % multiple == 0)

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
multiple = 2
result = sum_of_multiples(numbers, multiple)
print(result)  # Output: 30 (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10)
```

In both examples, the function `sum_of_multiples` takes a list of numbers and a specified multiple, then calculates and returns the sum of all numbers in the list that are multiples of the given number.

Write a Python function that takes a 2D grid of integers and returns the minimum path sum from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. You can only move down or right at any point in time.
INFO - [Task id] 67 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the minimum path sum in a 2D grid of integers, you can use a dynamic programming approach. Here’s a conceptual breakdown of how to implement this:

1. **Define the Problem**: You need to find the minimum sum of values along a path from the top-left corner (0,0) to the bottom-right corner (m-1,n-1) of a grid, where you can only move either down or right.

2. **Create a DP Table**: Use a 2D list (or array) to store the minimum path sums to each cell in the grid. The size of this table will be the same as the input grid.

3. **Initialize the DP Table**:
   - Set the value of the starting cell (0,0) in the DP table to be the same as the grid's starting cell.
   - Fill in the first row and first column of the DP table since there is only one way to reach those cells (either from the left for the first row or from above for the first column).

4. **Fill the DP Table**: Iterate through the grid starting from cell (0,0) to (m-1,n-1). For each cell (i,j), calculate the minimum path sum to that cell by taking the minimum of the path sums from the cell directly above it (i-1,j) and the cell directly to the left of it (i,j-1), and then adding the value of the current cell in the grid.

5. **Return the Result**: The value in the bottom-right corner of the DP table will contain the minimum path sum from the top-left to the bottom-right corner of the grid.

Here’s a simple outline of the function:

```python
def minPathSum(grid):
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0
    
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
    
    dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]
    
    # Fill the first row
    for j in range(1, n):
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + grid[0][j]
    
    # Fill the first column
    for i in range(1, m):
        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + grid[i][0]
    
    # Fill the rest of the dp table
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]
    
    return dp[m-1][n-1]
```

This function efficiently computes the minimum path sum using dynamic programming principles.

   - Set the value of the starting cell (0,0) in the DP table to be the same as the grid's starting cell.
   - Fill in the first row and first column of the DP table since there is only one way to reach those cells (either from the left for the first row or from above for the first column).

4. **Fill the DP Table**: Iterate through the grid starting from cell (0,0) to (m-1,n-1). For each cell (i,j), calculate the minimum path sum to that cell by taking the minimum of the path sums from the cell directly above it (i-1,j) and the cell directly to the left of it (i,j-1), and then adding the value of the current cell in the grid.

5. **Return the Result**: The value in the bottom-right corner of the DP table will contain the minimum path sum from the top-left to the bottom-right corner of the grid.

Here’s a simple outline of the function:

```python
def minPathSum(grid):
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0
    
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
    
    dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]
    
    # Fill the first row
    for j in range(1, n):
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + grid[0][j]
    
    # Fill the first column
    for i in range(1, m):
        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + grid[i][0]
    
    # Fill the rest of the dp table
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]
    
    return dp[m-1][n-1]
```

This function efficiently computes the minimum path sum using dynamic programming principles.

You are a Python programming assistant that assesses my progress of Python programming and provides useful guidance.

I will give you the following information:

[Task]: The objective I need to accomplish.

[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

INFO - [Task id] 67 [prompt] [Task]:
Write a Python function that takes a 2D grid of integers and returns the minimum path sum from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. You can only move down or right at any point in time.
[Context]: 
 Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the minimum path sum in a 2D grid of integers, you can use a dynamic programming approach. Here’s a conceptual breakdown of how to implement this:

1. **Define the Problem**: You need to find the minimum sum of values along a path from the top-left corner (0,0) to the bottom-right corner (m-1,n-1) of a grid, where you can only move either down or right.

2. **Create a DP Table**: Use a 2D list (or array) to store the minimum path sums to each cell in the grid. The size of this table will be the same as the input grid.

3. **Initialize the DP Table**:
   - Set the value of the starting cell (0,0) in the DP table to be the same as the grid's starting cell.
   - Fill in the first row and first column of the DP table since there is only one way to reach those cells (either from the left for the first row or from above for the first column).

4. **Fill the DP Table**: Iterate through the grid starting from cell (0,0) to (m-1,n-1). For each cell (i,j), calculate the minimum path sum to that cell by taking the minimum of the path sums from the cell directly above it (i-1,j) and the cell directly to the left of it (i,j-1), and then adding the value of the current cell in the grid.

5. **Return the Result**: The value in the bottom-right corner of the DP table will contain the minimum path sum from the top-left to the bottom-right corner of the grid.

Here’s a simple outline of the function:

```python
def minPathSum(grid):
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0
    
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
    
    dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]
    
    # Fill the first row
    for j in range(1, n):
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + grid[0][j]
    
    # Fill the first column
    for i in range(1, m):
        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + grid[i][0]
    
    # Fill the rest of the dp table
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]
    
    return dp[m-1][n-1]
```

This function efficiently computes the minimum path sum using dynamic programming principles.
