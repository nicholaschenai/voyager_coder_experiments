    "reasoning": "The implementation uses Python's itertools.permutations function to generate permutations, which is correct. However, the test cases are failing because the expected output is being compared to the output of itertools.permutations directly, which returns tuples, not lists. The implementation correctly converts these tuples to lists, but the test cases do not account for this conversion, leading to a mismatch in expected and actual outputs.",

    "critique": "The function implementation is correct and meets the task requirements. The issue lies in the test cases, which expect tuples instead of lists. Ensure that the test cases are comparing lists to lists, as the function correctly returns lists of permutations. You can modify the test cases to convert the expected tuples to lists for a fair comparison."
