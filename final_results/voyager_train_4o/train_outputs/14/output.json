    "reasoning": "The function implementation is incorrect because it appends the result of every 'pop' and 'peek' operation to the results list, even if the operation is not supposed to be recorded according to the test cases. This leads to extra entries in the results list, as seen in the failed test cases.",

This might involve adjusting the logic to only append results when certain conditions are met, or modifying the test cases to align with the current logic if they are incorrect."
