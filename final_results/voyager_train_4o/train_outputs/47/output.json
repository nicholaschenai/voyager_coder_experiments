    "reasoning": "The function implementation correctly identifies prime numbers and sums them from the given list. The helper function `is_prime` accurately checks for primality by iterating up to the square root of the number, which is efficient. The main function `sum_of_primes` iterates through the list, uses the helper function to check for prime numbers, and accumulates their sum. All provided test cases pass, indicating that the function works as expected for the tested scenarios.",
