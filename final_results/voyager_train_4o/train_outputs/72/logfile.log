You are a helpful assistant that asks questions to help me decide the next immediate task to do for Python programming.
My ultimate goal is to solve as many diverse problems as possible and become the best programmer in the world.

I will give you the following information:
Completed tasks so far: ...
Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should ask at least 5 questions (but no more than 10 questions) to help me decide the next immediate task to do. Each question should be followed by the concept that the question is about.
2) Your question should be specific to a concept in Python programming.
  Bad example (the question is too general):
    Question: What is the best way to program in Python?
    Concept: unknown
  Good example:
    Question: How do you reverse a list?
    Concept: list
3) Your questions should be self-contained and not require any context.

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```

You are a helpful assistant that tells me the next immediate task (in the form of a function) to do for Python programming.

Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. As a rule of thumb, guide me through beginner problems, followed by interview level problems, followed by competitive programming problems. The latter 2 levels can involve concepts from data structures and algorithms.
2) Please be very specific about what skills I need to learn.
3) Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for problems which I have not solved yet. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) The task should involve writing a main Python function that at most use basic libraries (try not to import too many or too advanced modules)
7) Do not give tasks that require file operations (create, read, update, delete) or an internet connection.
8) I am only allowed to write Python functions, so do not require me to write other things (e.g. objects). 
9) Requiring me to write a function that takes in an object and uses object methods is still ok, but I cannot define the objects myself. You must provide the objects as input to my function in the assert statement.

Take note of these in your response:
1) Give an expected function name for the task.
2) Give a tuple of 3 assert statements that tests the function's correctness in the "test_tuple" field. This must strictly contain single-line assert statements only; any setup code for the test must be filled in the "test_setup_code" field.
3) The function name which you gave must be called in the assert statements. 

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}

}

INFO - [Task id] 72 [prompt] Question 1: How do you implement a queue using a list in Python?
Answer: You can implement a queue using a list in Python by utilizing the `append()` method to add elements to the end of the list and the `pop(0)` method to remove elements from the front of the list. Here is a simple example:

```python
class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.queue = []

    def enqueue(self, item):
        self.queue.append(item)

    def dequeue(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.queue.pop(0)
        else:
            raise IndexError("dequeue from an empty queue")

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.queue) == 0

    def size(self):
        return len(self.queue)

# Example usage:
q = Queue()
q.enqueue(1)
q.enqueue(2)
q.enqueue(3)
print(q.dequeue())  # Output: 1
print(q.size())     # Output: 2
```

In this implementation:
- `enqueue` adds an item to the end of the queue.
- `dequeue` removes and returns the item from the front of the queue.
- `is_empty` checks if the queue is empty.
- `size` returns the number of items in the queue. 

Keep in mind that using a list for a queue can be inefficient for large queues because `pop(0)` has a time complexity of O(n). For better performance, consider using `collections.deque`, which is optimized for fast appends and pops from both ends.

Question 2: What is the best way to find the maximum product of any two integers in a list?
Answer: The best way to find the maximum product of any two integers in a list is to first identify the two largest integers in the list. You can do this efficiently in a single pass through the list. Here’s a simple approach:

1. Initialize two variables, `max1` and `max2`, to hold the largest and second largest integers, respectively.
2. Iterate through the list, updating `max1` and `max2` as you find larger integers.
3. The maximum product will be the product of `max1` and `max2`.

Here’s a sample implementation in Python:

```python
def max_product(nums):
    if len(nums) < 2:
        raise ValueError("At least two numbers are required")
    
    max1 = max2 = float('-inf')
    
    for num in nums:
        if num > max1:
            max2 = max1
            max1 = num
        elif num > max2:
            max2 = num
            
    return max1 * max2

# Example usage:
numbers = [3, 5, 1, 2, 4]
result = max_product(numbers)
print(result)  # Output: 20 (5 * 4)
```

This method runs in O(n) time complexity, making it efficient for large lists.

Question 3: How do you calculate the sum of all integers that are multiples of a given number in a list?
Answer: To calculate the sum of all integers that are multiples of a given number in a list, you can use a simple loop or a list comprehension in Python. Here’s an example using both methods:

### Using a loop:
```python
def sum_of_multiples(numbers, multiple):
    total = 0
    for number in numbers:
        if number % multiple == 0:
            total += number
    return total

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
multiple = 2
result = sum_of_multiples(numbers, multiple)
print(result)  # Output: 30 (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10)
```

### Using a list comprehension:
```python
def sum_of_multiples(numbers, multiple):
    return sum(number for number in numbers if number % multiple == 0)

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
multiple = 2
result = sum_of_multiples(numbers, multiple)
print(result)  # Output: 30 (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10)
```

In both examples, the function `sum_of_multiples` takes a list of numbers and a specified multiple, then calculates and returns the sum of all numbers in the list that are multiples of the given number.

Question 4: How can you implement a stack using a list in Python?
Answer: You can implement a stack using a list in Python by utilizing the list's built-in methods. A stack follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, which means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Here’s a simple implementation:

```python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.items) == 0

    def push(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)

    def pop(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items.pop()
        else:
            raise IndexError("pop from empty stack")

    def peek(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items[-1]
        else:
            raise IndexError("peek from empty stack")

    def size(self):
        return len(self.items)

# Example usage:
stack = Stack()
stack.push(1)
stack.push(2)
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 2
print(stack.peek()) # Output: 1
print(stack.size()) # Output: 1
```

In this implementation:
- `push(item)` adds an item to the top of the stack.
- `pop()` removes and returns the item from the top of the stack.
- `peek()` returns the item at the top of the stack without removing it.
- `is_empty()` checks if the stack is empty.
- `size()` returns the number of items in the stack.

Question 5: What is the method to find the longest increasing subsequence in a list of integers?
Answer: To find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in a list of integers, you can use dynamic programming or a more efficient method using binary search. Here are two common approaches:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - Create an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`.
   - Initialize all elements of `dp` to 1 since the minimum length of LIS ending at any element is 1 (the element itself).
   - For each element `nums[i]`, check all previous elements `nums[j]` (where `j < i`). If `nums[j] < nums[i]`, update `dp[i]` as `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`.
   - The length of the longest increasing subsequence will be the maximum value in the `dp` array.

   Here is a sample implementation:

   ```python
   def length_of_lis(nums):
       if not nums:
           return 0
       dp = [1] * len(nums)
       for i in range(1, len(nums)):
           for j in range(i):
               if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                   dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
       return max(dp)
   ```

2. **Binary Search Approach**:
   - Use a list to keep track of the smallest tail of all increasing subsequences found so far.
   - For each number in the input list, use binary search to determine its position in the tail list. If it can extend the largest subsequence, append it; otherwise, replace the existing value.
   - The length of the tail list at the end will give the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

   Here is a sample implementation:

   ```python
   from bisect import bisect_left

   def length_of_lis(nums):
       tails = []
       for num in nums:
           pos = bisect_left(tails, num)
           if pos == len(tails):
               tails.append(num)
           else:
               tails[pos] = num
       return len(tails)
   ```

Both methods will give you the length of the longest increasing subsequence, but the binary search approach is more efficient with a time complexity of O(n log n), while the dynamic programming approach has a time complexity of O(n^2).

Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of all integers that are multiples of 11. This task will help practice iterating through lists and applying conditional logic.
INFO - [Task id] 72 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of writing a Python function that sums all integers in a list that are multiples of 11, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a list of integers as an argument.

2. **Initialize a Sum Variable**: Create a variable to keep track of the sum of the multiples of 11. You can initialize it to zero.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to go through each integer in the provided list.

4. **Check for Multiples of 11**: For each integer, use the modulus operator (`%`) to check if it is a multiple of 11. An integer `n` is a multiple of 11 if `n % 11 == 0`.

5. **Update the Sum**: If the integer is a multiple of 11, add it to the sum variable.

6. **Return the Result**: After the loop has finished, return the sum variable.

Here is a conceptual outline of what the code might look like:

```python

    for number in int_list:  # Step 3: Iterate through the list

This function will effectively sum all integers in the input list that are multiples of 11 when called.

[Task]
Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of all integers that are multiples of 11. This task will help practice iterating through lists and applying conditional logic.
You must strictly follow the function name: sum_of_multiples_of_11

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of writing a Python function that sums all integers in a list that are multiples of 11, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a list of integers as an argument.

2. **Initialize a Sum Variable**: Create a variable to keep track of the sum of the multiples of 11. You can initialize it to zero.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to go through each integer in the provided list.

4. **Check for Multiples of 11**: For each integer, use the modulus operator (`%`) to check if it is a multiple of 11. An integer `n` is a multiple of 11 if `n % 11 == 0`.

5. **Update the Sum**: If the integer is a multiple of 11, add it to the sum variable.

6. **Return the Result**: After the loop has finished, return the sum variable.

Here is a conceptual outline of what the code might look like:

```python
def sum_multiples_of_11(int_list):
    total_sum = 0  # Step 2: Initialize sum variable
    for number in int_list:  # Step 3: Iterate through the list
        if number % 11 == 0:  # Step 4: Check for multiples of 11
            total_sum += number  # Step 5: Update the sum
    return total_sum  # Step 6: Return the result
```

This function will effectively sum all integers in the input list that are multiples of 11 when called.

You are a Python programming assistant that assesses my progress of Python programming and provides useful guidance.

I will give you the following information:

[Task]: The objective I need to accomplish.
[Context]: The context of the task. Serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help me on the task, but my priority is to follow instructions in the Task tag.
[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

You should only respond in JSON format as described below:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"description": "Represents the critique of a task attempt, including reasoning, success status, and suggestions for improvement.\n\nAttributes:\n    reasoning (str): Explanation of why the task was succeeded or failed.\n    success (bool): Indicates whether the task requirements were met.\n    critique (str): Suggestions or critique to help improve future task attempts.", "properties": {"reasoning": {"description": "reason why I have succeeded or failed at the task", "title": "Reasoning", "type": "string"}, "success": {"description": "evaluate if I have met the task requirements", "title": "Success", "type": "boolean"}, "critique": {"description": "critique to help me improve", "title": "Critique", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["reasoning", "success", "critique"]}

RESPONSE:
{
    "reasoning": "The implementation failed the test case where no subarray fulfills the condition",
    "success": false,
    "critique": "The issue in the implementation is due to the use of >= instead of > in the condition to update the result. Because of this, it returns a subarray even when the sum is greater than the target, as it still updates the result when the current subarray length is equal to the previous longest subarray length. To overcome this error, we should change the condition to only update the result when the current subarray length is strictly greater than the previous longest subarray length. This can be done by replacing >= with > in the condition."

This results in a runtime error when right goes beyond the list length. To overcome this error, we need to add a bounds check for the right variable in the mentioned while loop. We can modify the loop condition to while right < len(nums) and current_sum + nums[right] <= target:. This change will ensure that we only access elements within the bounds of the list, thus avoiding the IndexError."

INFO - [Task id] 72 [prompt] [Task]:
Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of all integers that are multiples of 11. This task will help practice iterating through lists and applying conditional logic.
[Context]: 
 Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of writing a Python function that sums all integers in a list that are multiples of 11, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a list of integers as an argument.

2. **Initialize a Sum Variable**: Create a variable to keep track of the sum of the multiples of 11. You can initialize it to zero.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to go through each integer in the provided list.

4. **Check for Multiples of 11**: For each integer, use the modulus operator (`%`) to check if it is a multiple of 11. An integer `n` is a multiple of 11 if `n % 11 == 0`.

5. **Update the Sum**: If the integer is a multiple of 11, add it to the sum variable.

6. **Return the Result**: After the loop has finished, return the sum variable.

Here is a conceptual outline of what the code might look like:

```python
def sum_multiples_of_11(int_list):
    total_sum = 0  # Step 2: Initialize sum variable
    for number in int_list:  # Step 3: Iterate through the list
        if number % 11 == 0:  # Step 4: Check for multiples of 11
            total_sum += number  # Step 5: Update the sum
    return total_sum  # Step 6: Return the result
```

This function will effectively sum all integers in the input list that are multiples of 11 when called.


[function impl]:


def sum_of_multiples_of_11(int_list):
    total_sum = 0
    for number in int_list:

            total_sum += number
    return total_sum
