    "reasoning": "The function implementation is incorrect because it does not match the expected input format for the test cases. The function `queue_operations` is designed to take a single argument, which is a list of operations, but the test cases are calling it with multiple arguments, which leads to an error. The test cases are incorrectly structured, expecting the function to take multiple arguments instead of a single list of operations.",
    "success": false,
    "critique": "To fix the implementation, ensure that the test cases pass a list of operations as a single argument to the `queue_operations` function. For example, instead of calling `queue_operations(queue, 'is_empty')`, you should call `queue_operations([('is_empty',)])`. This will align the test cases with the function's expected input format."
