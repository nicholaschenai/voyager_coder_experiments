    "reasoning": "The function implementation correctly follows the insertion sort algorithm. It iterates through the list, starting from the second element, and inserts each element into its correct position in the sorted portion of the list. The unit tests cover various scenarios, including an already sorted list, a reverse sorted list, and an empty list, all of which pass successfully. This indicates that the function is correctly sorting the list in ascending order as required by the task.",
