You are a helpful assistant that asks questions to help me decide the next immediate task to do for Python programming.
My ultimate goal is to solve as many diverse problems as possible and become the best programmer in the world.

I will give you the following information:
Completed tasks so far: ...
Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should ask at least 5 questions (but no more than 10 questions) to help me decide the next immediate task to do. Each question should be followed by the concept that the question is about.
2) Your question should be specific to a concept in Python programming.
  Bad example (the question is too general):
    Question: What is the best way to program in Python?
    Concept: unknown
  Good example:
    Question: How do you reverse a list?
    Concept: list
3) Your questions should be self-contained and not require any context.

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. As a rule of thumb, guide me through beginner problems, followed by interview level problems, followed by competitive programming problems. The latter 2 levels can involve concepts from data structures and algorithms.
2) Please be very specific about what skills I need to learn.
3) Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for problems which I have not solved yet. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) The task should involve writing a main Python function that at most use basic libraries (try not to import too many or too advanced modules)
7) Do not give tasks that require file operations (create, read, update, delete) or an internet connection.
8) I am only allowed to write Python functions, so do not require me to write other things (e.g. objects). 
9) Requiring me to write a function that takes in an object and uses object methods is still ok, but I cannot define the objects myself. You must provide the objects as input to my function in the assert statement.

Take note of these in your response:
1) Give an expected function name for the task.
2) Give a tuple of 3 assert statements that tests the function's correctness in the "test_tuple" field. This must strictly contain single-line assert statements only; any setup code for the test must be filled in the "test_setup_code" field.
3) The function name which you gave must be called in the assert statements. 

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.

}

INFO - [Task id] 29 [prompt] Question 1: How do you implement a binary search algorithm in Python?
Answer: To implement a binary search algorithm in Python, you can use either an iterative or a recursive approach. Below are examples of both methods.

### Iterative Approach

```python
def binary_search_iterative(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To prevent overflow
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Target found
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1  # Search in the right half
        else:
            right = mid - 1  # Search in the left half
            
    return -1  # Target not found
```

### Recursive Approach

```python
def binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, right):
    if left > right:
        return -1  # Target not found
    
    mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To prevent overflow
    
    if arr[mid] == target:
        return mid  # Target found
    elif arr[mid] < target:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, mid + 1, right)  # Search in the right half
    else:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, mid - 1)  # Search in the left half

# To use the recursive function, call it like this:
# result = binary_search_recursive(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
```

### Usage Example

```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
target = 5

# Using iterative approach
result_iterative = binary_search_iterative(arr, target)
print("Iterative result:", result_iterative)

# Using recursive approach
result_recursive = binary_search_recursive(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
print("Recursive result:", result_recursive)
```

### Note
- The array must be sorted for binary search to work correctly.
- The function returns the index of the target if found, or -1 if the target is not in the array.

Question 2: What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python, and when would you use each?
Answer: The main differences between a list and a tuple in Python are:

1. **Mutability**: 
   - Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their content (add, remove, or modify elements) after they are created.
   - Tuples are immutable, meaning once they are created, their content cannot be changed.

2. **Syntax**: 
   - Lists are defined using square brackets, e.g., `my_list = [1, 2, 3]`.
   - Tuples are defined using parentheses, e.g., `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)`.

3. **Performance**: 
   - Tuples can be slightly more memory-efficient and faster than lists due to their immutability, which allows for optimizations.

4. **Use Cases**:
   - Use lists when you need a collection of items that may change over time, such as a list of user inputs or a collection of items that you will modify.
   - Use tuples when you need a fixed collection of items that should not change, such as coordinates (x, y) or a record of data that should remain constant.

In summary, choose lists for mutable collections and tuples for immutable collections.

Question 3: How do you read and write files in Python?
Answer: In Python, you can read and write files using the built-in `open()` function. Here’s a basic overview of how to do both:

### Reading a File
To read a file, you can use the following code:

```python
# Open the file in read mode
with open('filename.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()  # Read the entire file
    print(content)  # Print the content of the file
```

You can also read the file line by line:

```python
with open('filename.txt', 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line.strip())  # Print each line without extra newline characters
```

### Writing to a File
To write to a file, you can use the following code:

```python
# Open the file in write mode (this will overwrite the file if it exists)
with open('filename.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write('Hello, World!\n')  # Write a string to the file
```

If you want to append to a file instead of overwriting it, you can use the append mode:

```python
with open('filename.txt', 'a') as file:
    file.write('Appending this line.\n')  # Append a string to the file
```

### Important Notes
- Always use the `with` statement when opening files. This ensures that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an error is raised.
- The modes you can use with `open()` include:
  - `'r'`: Read (default mode)
  - `'w'`: Write (overwrites the file)
  - `'a'`: Append
  - `'b'`: Binary mode (e.g., `'rb'` or `'wb'` for binary files)
  - `'x'`: Exclusive creation (fails if the file already exists)

This should give you a good starting point for reading and writing files in Python!

Question 4: What are decorators in Python and how do you use them?
Answer: Decorators in Python are a powerful and flexible way to modify or enhance the behavior of functions or methods. They allow you to wrap another function, adding functionality before or after the wrapped function runs, without modifying its code directly.

A decorator is typically defined as a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a new function that usually extends or alters the behavior of the original function.

Here's a simple example of how to create and use a decorator:

1. **Define a decorator**:
```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper
```

2. **Use the decorator**:
You can apply the decorator to a function using the `@decorator_name` syntax.

```python
@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

# Call the decorated function
say_hello()
```

When you call `say_hello()`, the output will be:
```
Something is happening before the function is called.
Hello!
Something is happening after the function is called.
```

In this example, `my_decorator` is a decorator that adds behavior before and after the `say_hello` function is executed.

Decorators can also take arguments, and they can be stacked (multiple decorators can be applied to a single function). They are commonly used in Python for logging, enforcing access control, instrumentation, and caching, among other use cases.

Question 5: How do you create a class in Python and instantiate objects from it?
Answer: To create a class in Python, you use the `class` keyword followed by the class name and a colon. Inside the class, you can define methods (functions) and attributes (variables) that belong to the class. To instantiate objects from the class, you call the class as if it were a function.

Here is a simple example:

```python
# Define a class
class Dog:
    # Constructor method to initialize attributes
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # Instance variable for the dog's name
        self.age = age    # Instance variable for the dog's age

    # Method to make the dog bark
    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"

# Instantiate objects from the class
dog1 = Dog("Buddy", 3)
dog2 = Dog("Max", 5)

# Accessing attributes and methods
print(dog1.name)  # Output: Buddy
print(dog2.age)   # Output: 5
print(dog1.bark())  # Output: Buddy says woof!
```

In this example, we created a `Dog` class with a constructor (`__init__`) that initializes the `name` and `age` attributes. We then created two instances of the `Dog` class, `dog1` and `dog2`, and demonstrated how to access their attributes and call their methods.

INFO - [Task id] 29 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of validating a string of brackets in Python, you can use a stack data structure. Here’s a conceptual breakdown of how to implement the function:

1. **Initialize a Stack**: Use a list to represent the stack where you will store opening brackets as you encounter them.

2. **Mapping of Brackets**: Create a dictionary to map each closing bracket to its corresponding opening bracket. This will help in checking if the brackets match correctly.

   - If the character is an opening bracket ('(', '{', or '['), push it onto the stack.
   - If the character is a closing bracket (')', '}', or ']'):
     - Check if the stack is empty. If it is, return False because there is no corresponding opening bracket.

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

The main function is `is_valid_parentheses`.
INFO - [Task id] 29 [generation text] This function checks if a given string of parentheses is valid by using a stack to track opening brackets and ensuring that each closing bracket corresponds to the most recent unmatched opening bracket. It iterates through each character in the string, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping from the stack when a closing bracket is encountered. If a closing bracket does not match the expected opening bracket or if there are unmatched opening brackets left in the stack at the end, the function returns False. If all brackets are matched correctly, it returns True. The function effectively handles different types of brackets, including parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets. Overall, it ensures that the brackets are properly nested and closed.
