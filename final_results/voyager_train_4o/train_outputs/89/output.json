    "reasoning": "The function implementation correctly follows the dynamic programming approach to solve the 0/1 Knapsack Problem. It initializes a DP table, iterates through each item and weight capacity, and updates the table based on whether including the current item yields a higher value than excluding it. The final result is correctly obtained from the bottom-right cell of the DP table, which represents the maximum value achievable with the given weight capacity. All provided test cases pass, indicating that the function meets the task requirements.",
