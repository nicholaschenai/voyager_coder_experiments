You are a helpful assistant that asks questions to help me decide the next immediate task to do for Python programming.
My ultimate goal is to solve as many diverse problems as possible and become the best programmer in the world.

I will give you the following information:
Completed tasks so far: ...
Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should ask at least 5 questions (but no more than 10 questions) to help me decide the next immediate task to do. Each question should be followed by the concept that the question is about.
2) Your question should be specific to a concept in Python programming.
  Bad example (the question is too general):
    Question: What is the best way to program in Python?
    Concept: unknown
  Good example:
    Question: How do you reverse a list?
    Concept: list
3) Your questions should be self-contained and not require any context.

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

You are a helpful assistant that answer my question about Python programming.

Question: ...

You will answer the question based on the context (only if available and helpful) and your own knowledge of Python programming.
1) Start your answer with "Answer: ".
2) Answer "Answer: Unknown" if you don't know the answer.

INFO - [Task id] 89 [prompt] Question: What is the approach to solve the coin change problem using dynamic programming?
INFO - [Task id] 89 [generation text] Answer: The coin change problem can be solved using dynamic programming by following these steps:

1. **Define the Problem**: The goal is to find the minimum number of coins needed to make a certain amount of money using a given set of coin denominations.

2. **Create a DP Array**: Initialize a list (or array) `dp` where `dp[i]` will represent the minimum number of coins needed to make the amount `i`. The size of this array should be `amount + 1`, initialized with a value greater than any possible number of coins (e.g., `float('inf')`), except for `dp[0]`, which should be `0` since no coins are needed to make the amount `0`.

3. **Fill the DP Array**: Iterate through each coin in the list of denominations. For each coin, update the `dp` array for all amounts from the coin's value up to the target amount. For each amount `j`, update `dp[j]` as follows:
   ```
   dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j - coin] + 1)
   ```
   This means that if using the current coin results in fewer coins than previously recorded in `dp[j]`, we update it.

4. **Result**: After processing all coins, the value at `dp[amount]` will give the minimum number of coins needed to make that amount. If `dp[amount]` is still `float('inf')`, it means that it is not possible to make that amount with the given denominations.

Here is a simple implementation in Python:

```python
def coin_change(coins, amount):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0  # Base case

    for coin in coins:
        for j in range(coin, amount + 1):
            dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j - coin] + 1)

    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1
```

In this implementation, `coins` is the list of coin denominations, and `amount` is the target amount. The function returns the minimum number of coins needed or `-1` if it's not possible to make that amount.

Question: ...

You will answer the question based on the context (only if available and helpful) and your own knowledge of Python programming.
1) Start your answer with "Answer: ".
2) Answer "Answer: Unknown" if you don't know the answer.

INFO - [Task id] 89 [prompt] Question: How do you find the shortest path in a weighted graph using Dijkstra's algorithm?
INFO - [Task id] 89 [generation text] Answer: To find the shortest path in a weighted graph using Dijkstra's algorithm, you can follow these steps:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a set of unvisited nodes (initially, all nodes are unvisited).
   - Assign a tentative distance value to every node: set it to zero for the initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.
   - Set the initial node as the current node.

2. **Visit Neighbors**:
   - For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. 
   - If the calculated distance to a neighbor is less than the previously recorded distance, update the neighbor's distance.

3. **Mark as Visited**:
   - Once all neighbors have been considered, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again.

4. **Select Next Node**:
   - If there are unvisited nodes, select the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance and set it as the new current node. If all remaining unvisited nodes have a tentative distance of infinity, the algorithm ends.

5. **Repeat**:
   - Repeat steps 2 to 4 until all nodes have been visited or the smallest tentative distance among the unvisited nodes is infinity.

6. **Path Reconstruction** (optional):
   - To reconstruct the shortest path, you can maintain a predecessor map that records the best previous node for each node. After reaching the target node, you can backtrack using this map to find the path.

Here is a simple implementation in Python:

```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    # Initialize distances and priority queue
    distances = {node: float('infinity') for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    priority_queue = [(0, start)]  # (distance, node)
    
    while priority_queue:
        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)
        
        # Nodes can only be visited once
        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:
            continue
        
        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():
            distance = current_distance + weight
            
            # Only consider this new path if it's better
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (distance, neighbor))
    
    return distances

# Example graph represented as an adjacency list
graph = {
    'A': {'B': 1, 'C': 4},
    'B': {'A': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 5},
    'C': {'A': 4, 'B': 2, 'D': 1},
    'D': {'B': 5, 'C': 1}
}

# Find shortest paths from node 'A'
shortest_paths = dijkstra(graph, 'A')
print(shortest_paths)
```

This code will output the shortest distances from the starting node 'A' to all other nodes in the graph.

Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. As a rule of thumb, guide me through beginner problems, followed by interview level problems, followed by competitive programming problems. The latter 2 levels can involve concepts from data structures and algorithms.
2) Please be very specific about what skills I need to learn.
3) Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for problems which I have not solved yet. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) The task should involve writing a main Python function that at most use basic libraries (try not to import too many or too advanced modules)
7) Do not give tasks that require file operations (create, read, update, delete) or an internet connection.
8) I am only allowed to write Python functions, so do not require me to write other things (e.g. objects). 
9) Requiring me to write a function that takes in an object and uses object methods is still ok, but I cannot define the objects myself. You must provide the objects as input to my function in the assert statement.

Take note of these in your response:
1) Give an expected function name for the task.
2) Give a tuple of 3 assert statements that tests the function's correctness in the "test_tuple" field. This must strictly contain single-line assert statements only; any setup code for the test must be filled in the "test_setup_code" field.
3) The function name which you gave must be called in the assert statements. 

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

INFO - [Task id] 89 [prompt] Question 1: How do you implement a binary search algorithm in Python?
Answer: To implement a binary search algorithm in Python, you can use either an iterative or a recursive approach. Below are examples of both methods.

### Iterative Approach

```python
def binary_search_iterative(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To prevent overflow
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Target found
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1  # Search in the right half
        else:
            right = mid - 1  # Search in the left half
            
    return -1  # Target not found
```

### Recursive Approach

```python
def binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, right):
    if left > right:
        return -1  # Target not found
    
    mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To prevent overflow
    
    if arr[mid] == target:
        return mid  # Target found
    elif arr[mid] < target:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, mid + 1, right)  # Search in the right half
    else:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, mid - 1)  # Search in the left half

# To use the recursive function, call it like this:
# result = binary_search_recursive(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
```

### Usage Example

```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
target = 5

# Using iterative approach
result_iterative = binary_search_iterative(arr, target)
print("Iterative result:", result_iterative)

# Using recursive approach
result_recursive = binary_search_recursive(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
print("Recursive result:", result_recursive)
```

### Note
- The array must be sorted for binary search to work correctly.
- The function returns the index of the target if found, or -1 if the target is not in the array.

Question 2: What is the best way to find the longest common subsequence between two strings?
Answer: The best way to find the longest common subsequence (LCS) between two strings is to use dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array (or table) where the cell at position (i, j) represents the length of the LCS of the substrings formed by the first i characters of the first string and the first j characters of the second string.

Here’s a step-by-step outline of the algorithm:

1. **Initialize a 2D array**: Create a 2D array `dp` of size (m+1) x (n+1), where m and n are the lengths of the two strings. Initialize all elements to 0.

2. **Fill the array**: Iterate through each character of both strings. If the characters match, set `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`. If they do not match, set `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.

3. **Backtrack to find the LCS**: After filling the table, the length of the LCS will be in `dp[m][n]`. To find the actual LCS, backtrack from `dp[m][n]` to reconstruct the sequence.

Here is a sample implementation in Python:

```python
def longest_common_subsequence(str1, str2):
    m, n = len(str1), len(str2)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]

    # Fill the dp array
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])

    # Backtrack to find the LCS
    lcs_length = dp[m][n]
    lcs = []
    while m > 0 and n > 0:
        if str1[m - 1] == str2[n - 1]:
            lcs.append(str1[m - 1])
            m -= 1
            n -= 1
        elif dp[m - 1][n] > dp[m][n - 1]:
            m -= 1
        else:
            n -= 1

    lcs.reverse()  # The LCS is built backwards
    return ''.join(lcs)

# Example usage
str1 = "AGGTAB"
str2 = "GXTXAYB"
print(longest_common_subsequence(str1, str2))  # Output: "GTAB"
```

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(m * n) and a space complexity of O(m * n), making it efficient for reasonably sized strings.

Question 3: How do you implement a breadth-first search (BFS) on a binary tree?
Answer: To implement a breadth-first search (BFS) on a binary tree, you can use a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes to be explored. Here’s a step-by-step approach along with a sample implementation in Python:

1. **Initialize a queue**: Start by adding the root node of the binary tree to the queue.
2. **Iterate while the queue is not empty**: Dequeue a node from the front of the queue, process it (e.g., print its value), and then enqueue its left and right children (if they exist).
3. **Continue until the queue is empty**: This ensures that all nodes at the current level are processed before moving to the next level.

Here’s a sample implementation:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def bfs(root):
    if not root:
        return
    
    queue = [root]  # Initialize the queue with the root node
    
    while queue:
        current = queue.pop(0)  # Dequeue the front node
        print(current.value)     # Process the current node
        
        # Enqueue left child if it exists
        if current.left:
            queue.append(current.left)
        
        # Enqueue right child if it exists
        if current.right:
            queue.append(current.right)

# Example usage:
# Constructing a simple binary tree
#         1
#        / \
#       2   3
#      / \
#     4   5

root = TreeNode(1)
root.left = TreeNode(2)
root.right = TreeNode(3)
root.left.left = TreeNode(4)
root.left.right = TreeNode(5)

bfs(root)  # Output: 1 2 3 4 5
```

In this implementation, the `bfs` function performs a breadth-first traversal of the binary tree, printing the values of the nodes in the order they are visited.

Question 4: What is the approach to solve the coin change problem using dynamic programming?
Answer: The coin change problem can be solved using dynamic programming by following these steps:

1. **Define the Problem**: The goal is to find the minimum number of coins needed to make a certain amount of money using a given set of coin denominations.

2. **Create a DP Array**: Initialize a list (or array) `dp` where `dp[i]` will represent the minimum number of coins needed to make the amount `i`. The size of this array should be `amount + 1`, initialized with a value greater than any possible number of coins (e.g., `float('inf')`), except for `dp[0]`, which should be `0` since no coins are needed to make the amount `0`.

3. **Fill the DP Array**: Iterate through each coin in the list of denominations. For each coin, update the `dp` array for all amounts from the coin's value up to the target amount. For each amount `j`, update `dp[j]` as follows:
   ```
   dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j - coin] + 1)
   ```
   This means that if using the current coin results in fewer coins than previously recorded in `dp[j]`, we update it.

4. **Result**: After processing all coins, the value at `dp[amount]` will give the minimum number of coins needed to make that amount. If `dp[amount]` is still `float('inf')`, it means that it is not possible to make that amount with the given denominations.

Here is a simple implementation in Python:

```python
def coin_change(coins, amount):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0  # Base case

    for coin in coins:
        for j in range(coin, amount + 1):
            dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j - coin] + 1)

    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1
```

In this implementation, `coins` is the list of coin denominations, and `amount` is the target amount. The function returns the minimum number of coins needed or `-1` if it's not possible to make that amount.

Question 5: How do you find the shortest path in a weighted graph using Dijkstra's algorithm?
Answer: To find the shortest path in a weighted graph using Dijkstra's algorithm, you can follow these steps:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a set of unvisited nodes (initially, all nodes are unvisited).
   - Assign a tentative distance value to every node: set it to zero for the initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.
   - Set the initial node as the current node.

2. **Visit Neighbors**:
   - For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. 
   - If the calculated distance to a neighbor is less than the previously recorded distance, update the neighbor's distance.

3. **Mark as Visited**:
   - Once all neighbors have been considered, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again.

4. **Select Next Node**:
   - If there are unvisited nodes, select the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance and set it as the new current node. If all remaining unvisited nodes have a tentative distance of infinity, the algorithm ends.

5. **Repeat**:
   - Repeat steps 2 to 4 until all nodes have been visited or the smallest tentative distance among the unvisited nodes is infinity.

6. **Path Reconstruction** (optional):
   - To reconstruct the shortest path, you can maintain a predecessor map that records the best previous node for each node. After reaching the target node, you can backtrack using this map to find the path.

Here is a simple implementation in Python:

```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    # Initialize distances and priority queue
    distances = {node: float('infinity') for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    priority_queue = [(0, start)]  # (distance, node)
    
    while priority_queue:
        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)
        
        # Nodes can only be visited once
        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:
            continue
        
        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():
            distance = current_distance + weight
            
            # Only consider this new path if it's better
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (distance, neighbor))
    
    return distances

# Example graph represented as an adjacency list
graph = {
    'A': {'B': 1, 'C': 4},
    'B': {'A': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 5},
    'C': {'A': 4, 'B': 2, 'D': 1},
    'D': {'B': 5, 'C': 1}
}

# Find shortest paths from node 'A'
shortest_paths = dijkstra(graph, 'A')
print(shortest_paths)
```

This code will output the shortest distances from the starting node 'A' to all other nodes in the graph.

	Write a Python function that takes a string and returns the first recurring character in it. If there are no recurring characters, return None. This task will help practice using hash maps for efficient data retrieval.

Failed tasks that are too hard: 
	Write a Python function that implements a queue using a list. The function should support enqueue (add an item to the end of the queue), dequeue (remove an item from the front of the queue), and is_empty (check if the queue is empty) operations. The function should return a tuple of results from these operations for testing purposes.
	Write a Python function that simulates a stack using a list. The function should support 'push' (add an item to the top of the stack), 'pop' (remove the item from the top of the stack), and 'peek' (return the item at the top of the stack without removing it) operations. The function should return a list of results from the 'pop' and 'peek' operations for testing purposes.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the maximum product of any two integers in the list. This will help practice iterating through lists and understanding pairwise comparisons.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of all integers that are multiples of a given number. This will help practice iterating through lists and applying conditional logic.

INFO - [Task id] 89 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
Write a Python function that solves the 0/1 Knapsack Problem. The function should take a list of items, each with a weight and a value, and an integer representing the maximum weight capacity of the knapsack. It should return the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting items without exceeding the weight capacity. Use dynamic programming to solve this problem.
INFO - [Task id] 89 [generation text] Answer: To solve the 0/1 Knapsack Problem using dynamic programming in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Problem**: You have a set of items, each with a specific weight and value, and a knapsack that can hold a maximum weight. The goal is to maximize the total value of the items in the knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity.

2. **Create a DP Table**: Use a 2D list (or array) to store the maximum value that can be achieved with a given weight capacity for each item. The dimensions of this table will be `(number of items + 1) x (maximum weight capacity + 1)`.

3. **Initialize the Table**: Set the first row and the first column of the table to zero. The first row represents the scenario where no items are considered, and the first column represents a knapsack with zero capacity.

4. **Fill the DP Table**: Iterate through each item and each possible weight capacity. For each item, decide whether to include it in the knapsack or not:
   - If the item's weight is less than or equal to the current capacity, you have two choices:
     - Include the item: Add its value to the maximum value of the remaining capacity (current capacity - item's weight).
     - Exclude the item: Take the maximum value from the previous item at the same capacity.
   - Update the table cell with the maximum of these two choices.

5. **Return the Result**: The value in the bottom-right cell of the DP table will represent the maximum value that can be obtained with the given weight capacity.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def knapsack(items, max_weight):
    n = len(items)
    # Create a DP table with (n+1) x (max_weight+1)
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(max_weight + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Fill the DP table
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        weight, value = items[i - 1]
        for w in range(max_weight + 1):
            if weight <= w:
                dp[i][w] = max(dp[i - 1][w], dp[i - 1][w - weight] + value)
            else:
                dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w]
    
    # The maximum value is in the bottom-right cell
    return dp[n][max_weight]
```

In this function:
- `items` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the weight and value of an item.
- `max_weight` is the maximum weight capacity of the knapsack.
- The function returns the maximum value that can be obtained without exceeding the weight capacity. 

This approach efficiently computes the solution using dynamic programming principles, ensuring that overlapping subproblems are solved only once.

[Task]
Write a Python function that solves the 0/1 Knapsack Problem. The function should take a list of items, each with a weight and a value, and an integer representing the maximum weight capacity of the knapsack. It should return the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting items without exceeding the weight capacity. Use dynamic programming to solve this problem.
You must strictly follow the function name: knapsack

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To solve the 0/1 Knapsack Problem using dynamic programming in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Problem**: You have a set of items, each with a specific weight and value, and a knapsack that can hold a maximum weight. The goal is to maximize the total value of the items in the knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity.

2. **Create a DP Table**: Use a 2D list (or array) to store the maximum value that can be achieved with a given weight capacity for each item. The dimensions of this table will be `(number of items + 1) x (maximum weight capacity + 1)`.

3. **Initialize the Table**: Set the first row and the first column of the table to zero. The first row represents the scenario where no items are considered, and the first column represents a knapsack with zero capacity.

4. **Fill the DP Table**: Iterate through each item and each possible weight capacity. For each item, decide whether to include it in the knapsack or not:
   - If the item's weight is less than or equal to the current capacity, you have two choices:
     - Include the item: Add its value to the maximum value of the remaining capacity (current capacity - item's weight).
     - Exclude the item: Take the maximum value from the previous item at the same capacity.
   - Update the table cell with the maximum of these two choices.

5. **Return the Result**: The value in the bottom-right cell of the DP table will represent the maximum value that can be obtained with the given weight capacity.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def knapsack(items, max_weight):
    n = len(items)
    # Create a DP table with (n+1) x (max_weight+1)
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(max_weight + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Fill the DP table
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        weight, value = items[i - 1]
        for w in range(max_weight + 1):
            if weight <= w:
                dp[i][w] = max(dp[i - 1][w], dp[i - 1][w - weight] + value)
            else:
                dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w]
    
    # The maximum value is in the bottom-right cell
    return dp[n][max_weight]
```

In this function:
- `items` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the weight and value of an item.
- `max_weight` is the maximum weight capacity of the knapsack.
- The function returns the maximum value that can be obtained without exceeding the weight capacity. 

This approach efficiently computes the solution using dynamic programming principles, ensuring that overlapping subproblems are solved only once.

This results in a runtime error when right goes beyond the list length. To overcome this error, we need to add a bounds check for the right variable in the mentioned while loop. We can modify the loop condition to while right < len(nums) and current_sum + nums[right] <= target:. This change will ensure that we only access elements within the bounds of the list, thus avoiding the IndexError."

INFO - [Task id] 89 [prompt] [Task]:
Write a Python function that solves the 0/1 Knapsack Problem. The function should take a list of items, each with a weight and a value, and an integer representing the maximum weight capacity of the knapsack. It should return the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting items without exceeding the weight capacity. Use dynamic programming to solve this problem.
[Context]: 
 Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To solve the 0/1 Knapsack Problem using dynamic programming in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Problem**: You have a set of items, each with a specific weight and value, and a knapsack that can hold a maximum weight. The goal is to maximize the total value of the items in the knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity.

2. **Create a DP Table**: Use a 2D list (or array) to store the maximum value that can be achieved with a given weight capacity for each item. The dimensions of this table will be `(number of items + 1) x (maximum weight capacity + 1)`.

3. **Initialize the Table**: Set the first row and the first column of the table to zero. The first row represents the scenario where no items are considered, and the first column represents a knapsack with zero capacity.

4. **Fill the DP Table**: Iterate through each item and each possible weight capacity. For each item, decide whether to include it in the knapsack or not:
   - If the item's weight is less than or equal to the current capacity, you have two choices:
     - Include the item: Add its value to the maximum value of the remaining capacity (current capacity - item's weight).
     - Exclude the item: Take the maximum value from the previous item at the same capacity.
   - Update the table cell with the maximum of these two choices.

5. **Return the Result**: The value in the bottom-right cell of the DP table will represent the maximum value that can be obtained with the given weight capacity.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def knapsack(items, max_weight):
    n = len(items)
    # Create a DP table with (n+1) x (max_weight+1)
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(max_weight + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Fill the DP table
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        weight, value = items[i - 1]
        for w in range(max_weight + 1):
            if weight <= w:
                dp[i][w] = max(dp[i - 1][w], dp[i - 1][w - weight] + value)
            else:
                dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w]
    
    # The maximum value is in the bottom-right cell
    return dp[n][max_weight]
```

In this function:
- `items` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the weight and value of an item.
- `max_weight` is the maximum weight capacity of the knapsack.
- The function returns the maximum value that can be obtained without exceeding the weight capacity. 

This approach efficiently computes the solution using dynamic programming principles, ensuring that overlapping subproblems are solved only once.


[function impl]:


def knapsack(items, max_weight):
    n = len(items)
    dp = [[0 for _ in range((max_weight + 1))] for _ in range((n + 1))]
    for i in range(1, (n + 1)):
        (weight, value) = items[(i - 1)]
        for w in range((max_weight + 1)):
            if (weight <= w):
                dp[i][w] = max(dp[(i - 1)][w], (dp[(i - 1)][(w - weight)] + value))
            else:
                dp[i][w] = dp[(i - 1)][w]
    return dp[n][max_weight]
