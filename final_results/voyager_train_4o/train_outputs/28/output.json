It then returns a sorted list of these duplicates, ensuring no duplicates in the result and that the result is sorted in ascending order. The unit tests cover various scenarios, including lists with no duplicates, lists with multiple duplicates of the same number, and lists with multiple different duplicates. All tests pass, indicating the function meets the task requirements.",
