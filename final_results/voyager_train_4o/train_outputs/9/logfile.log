You are a helpful assistant that asks questions to help me decide the next immediate task to do for Python programming.
My ultimate goal is to solve as many diverse problems as possible and become the best programmer in the world.

I will give you the following information:
Completed tasks so far: ...
Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should ask at least 5 questions (but no more than 10 questions) to help me decide the next immediate task to do. Each question should be followed by the concept that the question is about.
2) Your question should be specific to a concept in Python programming.
  Bad example (the question is too general):
    Question: What is the best way to program in Python?
    Concept: unknown
  Good example:
    Question: How do you reverse a list?
    Concept: list
3) Your questions should be self-contained and not require any context.

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

INFO - [Task id] 9 [prompt] Question: What is the best way to merge two sorted lists into a single sorted list?
INFO - [Task id] 9 [generation text] Answer: The best way to merge two sorted lists into a single sorted list is to use a two-pointer technique. This method involves iterating through both lists simultaneously and comparing the elements at the current pointers. Here’s a simple implementation in Python:

```python
def merge_sorted_lists(list1, list2):
    merged_list = []
    i, j = 0, 0

    while i < len(list1) and j < len(list2):
        if list1[i] < list2[j]:
            merged_list.append(list1[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            merged_list.append(list2[j])
            j += 1

    # Append any remaining elements from list1
    while i < len(list1):
        merged_list.append(list1[i])
        i += 1

    # Append any remaining elements from list2
    while j < len(list2):
        merged_list.append(list2[j])
        j += 1

    return merged_list

# Example usage:
list1 = [1, 3, 5]
list2 = [2, 4, 6]
result = merge_sorted_lists(list1, list2)
print(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

This approach efficiently merges the two lists in O(n + m) time complexity, where n and m are the lengths of the two lists.

INFO - [Task id] 9 [prompt] Question: How can you find the maximum and minimum values in a list without using built-in functions?
INFO - [Task id] 9 [generation text] Answer: You can find the maximum and minimum values in a list without using built-in functions by iterating through the list and keeping track of the current maximum and minimum values. Here’s a simple example of how to do this:

```python
def find_max_min(numbers):
    if not numbers:  # Check if the list is empty
        return None, None

    max_value = numbers[0]
    min_value = numbers[0]

    for number in numbers:
        if number > max_value:
            max_value = number
        if number < min_value:
            min_value = number

    return max_value, min_value

# Example usage
numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5]
max_value, min_value = find_max_min(numbers)
print("Maximum:", max_value)
print("Minimum:", min_value)
```

In this code, we initialize `max_value` and `min_value` with the first element of the list. We then iterate through each number in the list, updating `max_value` and `min_value` as needed. Finally, we return the maximum and minimum values found.

INFO - [Task id] 9 [prompt] Question: How do you create a class in Python and instantiate objects from it?
INFO - [Task id] 9 [generation text] Answer: To create a class in Python, you use the `class` keyword followed by the class name and a colon. Inside the class, you can define methods (functions) and attributes (variables) that belong to the class. To instantiate objects from the class, you call the class as if it were a function.

Here is a simple example:

```python
# Define a class
class Dog:
    # Constructor method to initialize attributes
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # Instance variable for the dog's name
        self.age = age    # Instance variable for the dog's age

    # Method to make the dog bark
    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"

# Instantiate objects from the class
dog1 = Dog("Buddy", 3)
dog2 = Dog("Max", 5)

# Accessing attributes and methods
print(dog1.name)  # Output: Buddy
print(dog2.age)   # Output: 5
print(dog1.bark())  # Output: Buddy says woof!
```

In this example, we created a `Dog` class with a constructor (`__init__`) that initializes the `name` and `age` attributes. We then created two instances of the `Dog` class, `dog1` and `dog2`, and demonstrated how to access their attributes and call their methods.

Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. As a rule of thumb, guide me through beginner problems, followed by interview level problems, followed by competitive programming problems. The latter 2 levels can involve concepts from data structures and algorithms.
2) Please be very specific about what skills I need to learn.
3) Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for problems which I have not solved yet. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) The task should involve writing a main Python function that at most use basic libraries (try not to import too many or too advanced modules)
7) Do not give tasks that require file operations (create, read, update, delete) or an internet connection.
8) I am only allowed to write Python functions, so do not require me to write other things (e.g. objects). 
9) Requiring me to write a function that takes in an object and uses object methods is still ok, but I cannot define the objects myself. You must provide the objects as input to my function in the assert statement.

Take note of these in your response:
1) Give an expected function name for the task.
2) Give a tuple of 3 assert statements that tests the function's correctness in the "test_tuple" field. This must strictly contain single-line assert statements only; any setup code for the test must be filled in the "test_setup_code" field.
3) The function name which you gave must be called in the assert statements. 

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:

INFO - [Task id] 9 [prompt] Question 1: How can you implement a stack using a list in Python?
Answer: You can implement a stack using a list in Python by utilizing the list's built-in methods. A stack follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, which means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Here’s a simple implementation:

```python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.items) == 0

    def push(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)

    def pop(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items.pop()
        else:
            raise IndexError("pop from empty stack")

    def peek(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items[-1]
        else:
            raise IndexError("peek from empty stack")

    def size(self):
        return len(self.items)

# Example usage:
stack = Stack()
stack.push(1)
stack.push(2)
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 2
print(stack.peek()) # Output: 1
print(stack.size()) # Output: 1
```

In this implementation:
- `push(item)` adds an item to the top of the stack.
- `pop()` removes and returns the item from the top of the stack.
- `peek()` returns the item at the top of the stack without removing it.
- `is_empty()` checks if the stack is empty.
- `size()` returns the number of items in the stack.

Question 2: What is the best way to merge two sorted lists into a single sorted list?
Answer: The best way to merge two sorted lists into a single sorted list is to use a two-pointer technique. This method involves iterating through both lists simultaneously and comparing the elements at the current pointers. Here’s a simple implementation in Python:

```python
def merge_sorted_lists(list1, list2):
    merged_list = []
    i, j = 0, 0

    while i < len(list1) and j < len(list2):
        if list1[i] < list2[j]:
            merged_list.append(list1[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            merged_list.append(list2[j])
            j += 1

    # Append any remaining elements from list1
    while i < len(list1):
        merged_list.append(list1[i])
        i += 1

    # Append any remaining elements from list2
    while j < len(list2):
        merged_list.append(list2[j])
        j += 1

    return merged_list

# Example usage:
list1 = [1, 3, 5]
list2 = [2, 4, 6]
result = merge_sorted_lists(list1, list2)
print(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

This approach efficiently merges the two lists in O(n + m) time complexity, where n and m are the lengths of the two lists.

Question 3: How can you find the maximum and minimum values in a list without using built-in functions?
Answer: You can find the maximum and minimum values in a list without using built-in functions by iterating through the list and keeping track of the current maximum and minimum values. Here’s a simple example of how to do this:

```python
def find_max_min(numbers):
    if not numbers:  # Check if the list is empty
        return None, None

    max_value = numbers[0]
    min_value = numbers[0]

    for number in numbers:
        if number > max_value:
            max_value = number
        if number < min_value:
            min_value = number

    return max_value, min_value

# Example usage
numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5]
max_value, min_value = find_max_min(numbers)
print("Maximum:", max_value)
print("Minimum:", min_value)
```

In this code, we initialize `max_value` and `min_value` with the first element of the list. We then iterate through each number in the list, updating `max_value` and `min_value` as needed. Finally, we return the maximum and minimum values found.

Question 4: What is the difference between deep copy and shallow copy in Python?
Answer: In Python, the difference between deep copy and shallow copy lies in how they handle the copying of objects and their nested objects.

- **Shallow Copy**: A shallow copy creates a new object, but it does not create copies of nested objects. Instead, it copies references to the original nested objects. This means that if you modify a nested object in the shallow copy, the change will also reflect in the original object because both the original and the shallow copy refer to the same nested object.

  You can create a shallow copy using the `copy` module's `copy()` function or by using the `list()` constructor for lists.

  Example:
  ```python
  import copy

  original = [1, 2, [3, 4]]
  shallow_copied = copy.copy(original)

  shallow_copied[2][0] = 'changed'
  print(original)  # Output: [1, 2, ['changed', 4]]
  ```

- **Deep Copy**: A deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all nested objects, creating entirely independent copies. This means that changes made to the deep copy will not affect the original object or its nested objects.

  You can create a deep copy using the `copy` module's `deepcopy()` function.

  Example:
  ```python
  import copy

  original = [1, 2, [3, 4]]
  deep_copied = copy.deepcopy(original)

  deep_copied[2][0] = 'changed'
  print(original)  # Output: [1, 2, [3, 4]]
  ```

In summary, use shallow copy when you want to copy an object but share nested objects, and use deep copy when you want to create a completely independent copy of an object and all its nested objects.

Question 5: How do you create a class in Python and instantiate objects from it?
Answer: To create a class in Python, you use the `class` keyword followed by the class name and a colon. Inside the class, you can define methods (functions) and attributes (variables) that belong to the class. To instantiate objects from the class, you call the class as if it were a function.

Here is a simple example:

```python
# Define a class
class Dog:
    # Constructor method to initialize attributes
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # Instance variable for the dog's name
        self.age = age    # Instance variable for the dog's age

    # Method to make the dog bark
    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"

# Instantiate objects from the class
dog1 = Dog("Buddy", 3)
dog2 = Dog("Max", 5)

# Accessing attributes and methods
print(dog1.name)  # Output: Buddy
print(dog2.age)   # Output: 5
print(dog1.bark())  # Output: Buddy says woof!
```

In this example, we created a `Dog` class with a constructor (`__init__`) that initializes the `name` and `age` attributes. We then created two instances of the `Dog` class, `dog1` and `dog2`, and demonstrated how to access their attributes and call their methods.

INFO - [Task id] 9 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order.
INFO - [Task id] 9 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of reversing a list of integers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a single parameter, which will be the list of integers.

2. **Create a New List**: Inside the function, you will need to create a new list that will hold the reversed elements.

3. **Iterate Over the Original List**: Use a loop to iterate over the original list from the last element to the first. This can be done using a `for` loop with the `range` function, or by using Python's slicing capabilities.

4. **Append Elements**: During each iteration, append the current element to the new list.

5. **Return the New List**: After the loop completes, return the new list containing the elements in reverse order.

Here’s a simple example of how this can be implemented:

```python
def reverse_list(input_list):
    reversed_list = []
    for i in range(len(input_list) - 1, -1, -1):
        reversed_list.append(input_list[i])
    return reversed_list
```

Alternatively, you can achieve the same result more concisely using Python's slicing feature:

```python
def reverse_list(input_list):
    return input_list[::-1]
```

In both cases, the function takes a list of integers and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order.

Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable.

    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests

You are a Python programming assistant that assesses my progress of Python programming and provides useful guidance.

I will give you the following information:

[Task]: The objective I need to accomplish.
[Context]: The context of the task. Serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help me on the task, but my priority is to follow instructions in the Task tag.
[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

You should only respond in JSON format as described below:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
