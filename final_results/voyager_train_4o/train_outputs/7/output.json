It iterates over the list multiple times, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until the list is sorted in ascending order. The unit tests provided cover a variety of cases, including positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero, and all tests pass successfully, indicating that the function works as intended.",
