It uses a loop to iterate through numbers starting from 2 up to n-1, and checks for primality by testing divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. This is an efficient method for checking primality and ensures that only prime numbers are added to the list. The unit tests provided cover a range of scenarios, including small numbers and edge cases, and all tests pass successfully, indicating that the function meets the task requirements.",
