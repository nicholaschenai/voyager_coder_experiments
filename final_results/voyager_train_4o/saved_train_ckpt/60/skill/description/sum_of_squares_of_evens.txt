[description for function: sum_of_squares_of_evens]
This function calculates the sum of the squares of all even numbers in a given list. It initializes a total sum to zero and iterates through each number in the list. For each number, it checks if the number is even by using the modulus operator. If the number is even, its square is added to the total sum. Finally, the function returns the computed total sum of the squares of the even numbers.
