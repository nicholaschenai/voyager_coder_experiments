[description for function: next_greater_elements]
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list where each element is replaced by the next greater element in the original list. If no greater element exists for a particular position, it is replaced with -1. The function uses a stack to keep track of indices of the elements as it iterates through the list. For each element, it checks if it is greater than the element at the index stored at the top of the stack, and if so, it updates the result list accordingly. The process continues until all elements have been processed. The final result is a list of the next greater elements or -1 where applicable.
