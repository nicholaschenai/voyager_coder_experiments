[description for function: sum_of_evens]
This function takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the sum of all even numbers within that list. It initializes a total variable to zero and iterates through each number in the input list. For each number, it checks if the number is even by using the modulus operator. If the number is even, it adds it to the total. Finally, the function returns the computed total of even numbers. The result is the sum of all even integers found in the provided list.
