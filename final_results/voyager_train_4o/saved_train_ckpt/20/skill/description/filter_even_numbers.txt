[description for function: filter_even_numbers]
This function takes a list of numbers as input and iterates through each number to check if it is even. If a number is found to be even (i.e., divisible by 2 with no remainder), it is added to a new list. After processing all the numbers, the function returns the list containing only the even numbers. The output will be an array that excludes any odd numbers from the original input. This allows users to easily filter out even values from a mixed list of integers. The function effectively provides a simple way to identify and collect even numbers.
