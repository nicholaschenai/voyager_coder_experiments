[description for function: count_string_occurrences]
This function takes a list of strings as input and counts the occurrences of each unique string in that list. It initializes an empty dictionary to store the counts. As it iterates through the list, it checks if each string is already a key in the dictionary; if so, it increments the count, otherwise, it adds the string with a count of one. Finally, it returns the dictionary containing the strings and their corresponding counts. This allows for easy retrieval of how many times each string appears in the input list. The function effectively summarizes the frequency of each string in the provided list.
