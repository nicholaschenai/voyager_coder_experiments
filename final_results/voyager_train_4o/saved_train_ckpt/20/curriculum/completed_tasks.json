        "Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.",
        "Write a Python function that takes a list of strings and returns a dictionary where the keys are the strings and the values are the number of times each string appears in the list.",
        "Write a Python function that takes a list of strings and returns a dictionary where the keys are the lengths of the strings and the values are lists of strings of that length.",
        "Write a Python function that takes a string and returns the first non-repeating character in it. If all characters repeat, return None.",
        "Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a list of all unique pairs (as tuples) that sum up to a given target integer. The pairs should be sorted in ascending order, and each pair should be sorted as well.",
        "Write a Python function that takes a string and returns the longest substring without repeating characters.",
        "Write a Python function that takes two lists of integers and returns a list of their common elements. The result should not contain duplicates and should be sorted in ascending order.",
        "Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and sorts it in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm. The function should return the sorted list.",
        "Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order.",
        "Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numbers in the list. Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.",
        "Write a Python function that takes a string and returns a new string with all the vowels removed. The function should be case-insensitive, meaning it should remove both uppercase and lowercase vowels.",
        "Write a Python function that takes two lists of integers and returns a list of integers that are present in both lists, without duplicates. Use set operations to achieve this.",
        "Write a Python function that takes a list of operations (as strings) and simulates a stack using a list. The operations can be 'push X' to push an integer X onto the stack, 'pop' to remove the top element, and 'peek' to return the top element without removing it. The function should return a list of results from the 'pop' and 'peek' operations.",
        "Write a Python function that takes two lists of integers and returns a list of integers that are present in either of the lists but not in both. The result should not contain duplicates and should be sorted in ascending order.",
        "Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a dictionary where the keys are the integers and the values are the number of times each integer appears in the list. This will help practice using dictionaries for counting occurrences.",
        "Write a Python function that takes an integer n and returns a list of all prime numbers less than n. This will help you practice loops, conditionals, and understanding of prime numbers.",
        "Write a Python function that takes a string and a pattern (both strings) and returns True if the pattern is found in the string, and False otherwise. The function should perform a simple substring search.",
        "Write a Python function that calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer using recursion. The function should return the factorial value."
