[description for function: find_duplicates]
This function takes a list as input and identifies the elements that appear more than once. It utilizes the Counter class from the collections module to count the occurrences of each element in the list. The function then creates a set of elements that have a count greater than one, indicating they are duplicates. Finally, it returns a sorted list of these duplicate elements. The output is a list containing only the unique duplicates, arranged in ascending order. This allows for easy identification of repeated items in the original list.
