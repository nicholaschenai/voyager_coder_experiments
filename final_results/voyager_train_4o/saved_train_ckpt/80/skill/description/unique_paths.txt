[description for function: unique_paths]
This function calculates the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a grid with dimensions m by n, where movement is restricted to only right and down. It initializes a 2D list to store the number of ways to reach each cell in the grid. The first row and first column are filled with 1s, representing the only way to reach those cells. It then iteratively fills in the rest of the grid by summing the number of ways to reach the cell from the cell above and the cell to the left. Finally, it returns the value in the bottom-right corner of the grid, which represents the total number of unique paths. This approach utilizes dynamic programming to efficiently compute the result.
