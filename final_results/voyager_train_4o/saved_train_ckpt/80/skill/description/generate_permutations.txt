[description for function: generate_permutations]
This function takes a list of integers as input and generates all possible permutations of the elements in that list. It utilizes the permutations function from the itertools module to create these arrangements. Each permutation is returned as a list, resulting in a list of lists containing all unique permutations. The output will include every possible ordering of the input integers. This function is useful for scenarios where different arrangements of a set of items are needed. The final result is a comprehensive collection of all permutations of the provided integer list.
