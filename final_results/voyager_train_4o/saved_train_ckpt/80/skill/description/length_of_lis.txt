[description for function: length_of_lis]
This function calculates the length of the longest increasing subsequence in a given list of numbers. It utilizes a dynamic programming approach with binary search to efficiently maintain a list that represents the smallest possible tail values for increasing subsequences of various lengths. As it iterates through each number in the input list, it determines the appropriate position to either append the number or replace an existing value in the list. The final result is the length of this list, which corresponds to the length of the longest increasing subsequence. The use of the `bisect` module allows for efficient insertion and searching within the list. Overall, the function provides an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n log n).
