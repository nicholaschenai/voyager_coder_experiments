[description for function: symmetric_difference]
This function calculates the symmetric difference between two lists by converting them into sets, which allows for the identification of elements that are unique to each set. It uses the symmetric difference operator to find elements that are in either of the sets but not in both. The resulting set is then sorted to produce a list of the unique elements in ascending order. Finally, the function returns this sorted list. This provides a clear and efficient way to determine the unique elements from two input lists.
