[description for function: prefix_sum]
This function calculates the cumulative sum of a list of numbers. It initializes an empty list to store the results and a variable to keep track of the running total. As it iterates through each number in the input list, it adds the current number to the cumulative total and appends this total to the results list. Finally, it returns the list of cumulative sums. The output reflects the sum of all previous numbers up to each index in the input list. This is useful for quickly obtaining the sum of elements in a range.
