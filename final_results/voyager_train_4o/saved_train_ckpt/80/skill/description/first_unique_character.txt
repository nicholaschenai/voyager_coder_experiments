[description for function: first_unique_character]
This function takes a string as input and counts the occurrences of each character in it. It uses a dictionary to store the count of each character. After counting, it iterates through the string again to find the first character that appears only once. If such a character is found, it is returned; otherwise, the function returns None. The function effectively identifies the first unique character in the given string.
