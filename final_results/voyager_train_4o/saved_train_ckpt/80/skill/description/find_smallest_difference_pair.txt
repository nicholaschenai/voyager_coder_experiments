[description for function: find_smallest_difference_pair]
This function takes a list of numbers, sorts it, and then finds the pair of adjacent numbers with the smallest absolute difference, returning that pair. It initializes a variable to track the minimum difference and the closest pair found. As it iterates through the sorted list, it calculates the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers. If a smaller difference is found, it updates the minimum difference and the closest pair. Finally, it returns the pair of numbers that have the smallest difference. The function effectively identifies the closest values in the input list.
