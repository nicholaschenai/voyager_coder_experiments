[description for function: group_strings_by_length]
This function takes a list of strings and organizes them into a dictionary where the keys are the lengths of the strings and the values are lists of strings that share the same length. It iterates through each string in the input list, calculates its length, and then adds it to the corresponding list in the dictionary. If a length key already exists, the string is appended to the existing list; otherwise, a new list is created for that length. Finally, the function returns the constructed dictionary, providing a clear grouping of strings by their lengths. This allows for easy access to all strings of a specific length. The output is a structured representation of the input strings based on their lengths.
