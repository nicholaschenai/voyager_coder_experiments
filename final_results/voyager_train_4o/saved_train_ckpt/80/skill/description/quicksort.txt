[description for function: quicksort]
This function implements the quicksort algorithm to sort an array. It first checks if the array has one or no elements, in which case it returns the array as is. If the array has more than one element, it selects a pivot element and partitions the array into three sub-arrays: those less than the pivot, those equal to the pivot, and those greater than the pivot. It then recursively sorts the left and right sub-arrays. Finally, it combines the sorted left sub-array, the middle sub-array, and the sorted right sub-array to produce the final sorted array. The function effectively sorts the input array in ascending order.
