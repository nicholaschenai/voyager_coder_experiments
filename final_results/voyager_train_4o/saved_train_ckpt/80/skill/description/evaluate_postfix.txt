[description for function: evaluate_postfix]
This function evaluates a postfix expression represented as a list of tokens. It uses a stack to store operands and processes each token in the expression sequentially. When a digit is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack, while operators trigger the popping of the top two operands for computation. The result of the operation is then pushed back onto the stack. At the end of the evaluation, the final result is returned from the stack. This allows for the calculation of expressions in postfix notation efficiently.
