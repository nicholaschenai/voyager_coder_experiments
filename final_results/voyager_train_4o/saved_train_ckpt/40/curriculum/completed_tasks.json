        "Write a Python function that takes a string containing only the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', and returns True if the input string is valid. An input string is valid if: 1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets. 2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order. The function should return False otherwise.",
        "Write a Python function that takes a list of strings representing a postfix expression (Reverse Polish Notation) and returns the evaluated result as an integer. The function should use a stack to evaluate the expression.",
        "Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the second largest unique integer in the list. If there is no such integer, return None. This task will help you practice using sets for unique elements and sorting techniques.",
        "Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a dictionary where the keys are the integers and the values are lists of indices where each integer appears in the list. This will help practice using dictionaries to store lists and track multiple occurrences of elements.",
