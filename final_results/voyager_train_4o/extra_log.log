You are a helpful assistant that tells me the next immediate task (in the form of a function) to do for Python programming.

Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. As a rule of thumb, guide me through beginner problems, followed by interview level problems, followed by competitive programming problems. The latter 2 levels can involve concepts from data structures and algorithms.
2) Please be very specific about what skills I need to learn.
3) Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for problems which I have not solved yet. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) The task should involve writing a main Python function that at most use basic libraries (try not to import too many or too advanced modules)
7) Do not give tasks that require file operations (create, read, update, delete) or an internet connection.
8) I am only allowed to write Python functions, so do not require me to write other things (e.g. objects). 
9) Requiring me to write a function that takes in an object and uses object methods is still ok, but I cannot define the objects myself. You must provide the objects as input to my function in the assert statement.

Take note of these in your response:
1) Give an expected function name for the task.
2) Give a tuple of 3 assert statements that tests the function's correctness in the "test_tuple" field. This must strictly contain single-line assert statements only; any setup code for the test must be filled in the "test_setup_code" field.
3) The function name which you gave must be called in the assert statements. 

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.

}

INFO - [Task id] 95 [prompt] Question 1: How do you implement a queue using a list in Python?
Answer: You can implement a queue using a list in Python by utilizing the `append()` method to add elements to the end of the list and the `pop(0)` method to remove elements from the front of the list. Here is a simple example:

```python
class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.queue = []

    def enqueue(self, item):
        self.queue.append(item)

    def dequeue(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.queue.pop(0)
        else:
            raise IndexError("dequeue from an empty queue")

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.queue) == 0

    def size(self):
        return len(self.queue)

# Example usage:
q = Queue()
q.enqueue(1)
q.enqueue(2)
q.enqueue(3)
print(q.dequeue())  # Output: 1
print(q.size())     # Output: 2
```

In this implementation:
- `enqueue` adds an item to the end of the queue.
- `dequeue` removes and returns the item from the front of the queue.
- `is_empty` checks if the queue is empty.
- `size` returns the number of items in the queue. 

Keep in mind that using a list for a queue can be inefficient for large queues because `pop(0)` has a time complexity of O(n). For better performance, consider using `collections.deque`, which is optimized for fast appends and pops from both ends.

Question 2: What is the best way to find the maximum product of any two integers in a list?
Answer: The best way to find the maximum product of any two integers in a list is to first identify the two largest integers in the list. You can do this efficiently in a single pass through the list. Here’s a simple approach:

1. Initialize two variables, `max1` and `max2`, to hold the largest and second largest integers, respectively.
2. Iterate through the list, updating `max1` and `max2` as you find larger integers.
3. The maximum product will be the product of `max1` and `max2`.

Here’s a sample implementation in Python:

```python
def max_product(nums):
    if len(nums) < 2:
        raise ValueError("At least two numbers are required")
    
    max1 = max2 = float('-inf')
    
    for num in nums:
        if num > max1:
            max2 = max1
            max1 = num
        elif num > max2:
            max2 = num
            
    return max1 * max2

# Example usage:
numbers = [3, 5, 1, 2, 4]
result = max_product(numbers)
print(result)  # Output: 20 (5 * 4)
```

This method runs in O(n) time complexity, making it efficient for large lists.

Question 3: How do you calculate the sum of all integers that are multiples of a given number in a list?
Answer: To calculate the sum of all integers that are multiples of a given number in a list, you can use a simple loop or a list comprehension in Python. Here’s an example using both methods:

### Using a loop:
```python
def sum_of_multiples(numbers, multiple):
    total = 0
    for number in numbers:
        if number % multiple == 0:
            total += number
    return total

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
multiple = 2
result = sum_of_multiples(numbers, multiple)
print(result)  # Output: 30 (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10)
```

### Using a list comprehension:
```python
def sum_of_multiples(numbers, multiple):
    return sum(number for number in numbers if number % multiple == 0)

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
multiple = 2
result = sum_of_multiples(numbers, multiple)
print(result)  # Output: 30 (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10)
```

In both examples, the function `sum_of_multiples` takes a list of numbers and a specified multiple, then calculates and returns the sum of all numbers in the list that are multiples of the given number.

Question 4: How do you perform a depth-first search (DFS) on a graph represented as an adjacency list?
Answer: To perform a depth-first search (DFS) on a graph represented as an adjacency list, you can use either a recursive approach or an iterative approach using a stack. Below is an example of both methods in Python.

### Graph Representation
First, let's assume the graph is represented as an adjacency list using a dictionary:

```python
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['D', 'E'],
    'C': ['F'],
    'D': [],
    'E': ['F'],
    'F': []
}
```

### Recursive DFS
Here is how you can implement DFS recursively:

```python
def dfs_recursive(node, visited):
    if node not in visited:
        print(node)  # Process the node (e.g., print it)
        visited.add(node)  # Mark the node as visited
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            dfs_recursive(neighbor, visited)

visited = set()
dfs_recursive('A', visited)
```

### Iterative DFS
Here is how you can implement DFS iteratively using a stack:

```python
def dfs_iterative(start):
    visited = set()
    stack = [start]

    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        if node not in visited:
            print(node)  # Process the node (e.g., print it)
            visited.add(node)  # Mark the node as visited
            # Add neighbors to the stack (reverse order to maintain correct order)
            stack.extend(reversed(graph[node]))

dfs_iterative('A')
```

### Explanation
- In both methods, we maintain a set called `visited` to keep track of the nodes that have already been processed.
- In the recursive method, we call the function recursively for each unvisited neighbor.
- In the iterative method, we use a stack to keep track of the nodes to visit next, processing each node by popping it from the stack.

You can choose either method based on your preference or the specific requirements of your application.

Question 5: What is the approach to find the length of the longest contiguous subarray with a sum equal to zero?
Answer: To find the length of the longest contiguous subarray with a sum equal to zero, you can use a hash map (dictionary in Python) to store the cumulative sums and their corresponding indices. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the cumulative sum and a variable to store the maximum length of the subarray found.
2. Create a hash map to store the cumulative sum as the key and the index as the value.
3. Iterate through the array, updating the cumulative sum at each index.
4. For each cumulative sum:
   - If the cumulative sum is zero, update the maximum length to the current index + 1 (since the subarray starts from index 0).
   - If the cumulative sum has been seen before (exists in the hash map), calculate the length of the subarray from the previous index of that cumulative sum to the current index. Update the maximum length if this new length is greater.
   - If the cumulative sum has not been seen before, store it in the hash map with the current index.

Here is a sample implementation in Python:

```python
def max_len_zero_sum_subarray(arr):
    cum_sum = 0
    max_length = 0
    sum_index_map = {}

    for i in range(len(arr)):
        cum_sum += arr[i]

        if cum_sum == 0:
            max_length = i + 1  # Subarray from index 0 to i

        if cum_sum in sum_index_map:
            # Calculate the length of the subarray
            length = i - sum_index_map[cum_sum]
            max_length = max(max_length, length)
        else:
            # Store the index of the first occurrence of this cumulative sum
            sum_index_map[cum_sum] = i

    return max_length
```

This approach runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the array, and it uses O(n) space for the hash map.

You are a helpful assistant that tells me the next immediate task (in the form of a function) to do for Python programming. 
My ultimate goal is to solve as many diverse problems as possible and become the best programmer in the world.

I will give you the following information:

Question 3: ...
Answer: ...

Completed tasks so far: ...
Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. As a rule of thumb, guide me through beginner problems, followed by interview level problems, followed by competitive programming problems. The latter 2 levels can involve concepts from data structures and algorithms.
2) Please be very specific about what skills I need to learn.
3) Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for problems which I have not solved yet. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) The task should involve writing a main Python function that at most use basic libraries (try not to import too many or too advanced modules)
7) Do not give tasks that require file operations (create, read, update, delete) or an internet connection.
8) I am only allowed to write Python functions, so do not require me to write other things (e.g. objects). 
9) Requiring me to write a function that takes in an object and uses object methods is still ok, but I cannot define the objects myself. You must provide the objects as input to my function in the assert statement.

Take note of these in your response:
1) Give an expected function name for the task.
2) Give a tuple of 3 assert statements that tests the function's correctness in the "test_tuple" field. This must strictly contain single-line assert statements only; any setup code for the test must be filled in the "test_setup_code" field.
3) The function name which you gave must be called in the assert statements. 

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}

INFO - [Task id] 95 [prompt] Question 1: How do you implement a queue using a list in Python?
Answer: You can implement a queue using a list in Python by utilizing the `append()` method to add elements to the end of the list and the `pop(0)` method to remove elements from the front of the list. Here is a simple example:

```python
class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.queue = []

    def enqueue(self, item):
        self.queue.append(item)

    def dequeue(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.queue.pop(0)
        else:
            raise IndexError("dequeue from an empty queue")

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.queue) == 0

    def size(self):
        return len(self.queue)

# Example usage:
q = Queue()
q.enqueue(1)
q.enqueue(2)
q.enqueue(3)
print(q.dequeue())  # Output: 1
print(q.size())     # Output: 2
```

In this implementation:
- `enqueue` adds an item to the end of the queue.
- `dequeue` removes and returns the item from the front of the queue.
- `is_empty` checks if the queue is empty.
- `size` returns the number of items in the queue. 

Keep in mind that using a list for a queue can be inefficient for large queues because `pop(0)` has a time complexity of O(n). For better performance, consider using `collections.deque`, which is optimized for fast appends and pops from both ends.

Question 2: What is the best way to find the maximum product of any two integers in a list?
Answer: The best way to find the maximum product of any two integers in a list is to first identify the two largest integers in the list. You can do this efficiently in a single pass through the list. Here’s a simple approach:

1. Initialize two variables, `max1` and `max2`, to hold the largest and second largest integers, respectively.
2. Iterate through the list, updating `max1` and `max2` as you find larger integers.
3. The maximum product will be the product of `max1` and `max2`.

Here’s a sample implementation in Python:

```python
def max_product(nums):
    if len(nums) < 2:
        raise ValueError("At least two numbers are required")
    
    max1 = max2 = float('-inf')
    
    for num in nums:
        if num > max1:
            max2 = max1
            max1 = num
        elif num > max2:
            max2 = num
            
    return max1 * max2

# Example usage:
numbers = [3, 5, 1, 2, 4]
result = max_product(numbers)
print(result)  # Output: 20 (5 * 4)
```

This method runs in O(n) time complexity, making it efficient for large lists.

Question 3: How do you calculate the sum of all integers that are multiples of a given number in a list?
Answer: To calculate the sum of all integers that are multiples of a given number in a list, you can use a simple loop or a list comprehension in Python. Here’s an example using both methods:

### Using a loop:
```python
def sum_of_multiples(numbers, multiple):
    total = 0
    for number in numbers:
        if number % multiple == 0:
            total += number
    return total

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
multiple = 2
result = sum_of_multiples(numbers, multiple)
print(result)  # Output: 30 (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10)
```

### Using a list comprehension:
```python
def sum_of_multiples(numbers, multiple):
    return sum(number for number in numbers if number % multiple == 0)

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
multiple = 2
result = sum_of_multiples(numbers, multiple)
print(result)  # Output: 30 (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10)
```

In both examples, the function `sum_of_multiples` takes a list of numbers and a specified multiple, then calculates and returns the sum of all numbers in the list that are multiples of the given number.

Question 4: How do you perform a depth-first search (DFS) on a graph represented as an adjacency list?
Answer: To perform a depth-first search (DFS) on a graph represented as an adjacency list, you can use either a recursive approach or an iterative approach using a stack. Below is an example of both methods in Python.

### Graph Representation
First, let's assume the graph is represented as an adjacency list using a dictionary:

```python
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['D', 'E'],
    'C': ['F'],
    'D': [],
    'E': ['F'],
    'F': []
}
```

### Recursive DFS
Here is how you can implement DFS recursively:

```python
def dfs_recursive(node, visited):
    if node not in visited:
        print(node)  # Process the node (e.g., print it)
        visited.add(node)  # Mark the node as visited
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            dfs_recursive(neighbor, visited)

visited = set()
dfs_recursive('A', visited)
```

### Iterative DFS
Here is how you can implement DFS iteratively using a stack:

```python
def dfs_iterative(start):
    visited = set()
    stack = [start]

    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        if node not in visited:
            print(node)  # Process the node (e.g., print it)
            visited.add(node)  # Mark the node as visited
            # Add neighbors to the stack (reverse order to maintain correct order)
            stack.extend(reversed(graph[node]))

dfs_iterative('A')
```

### Explanation
- In both methods, we maintain a set called `visited` to keep track of the nodes that have already been processed.
- In the recursive method, we call the function recursively for each unvisited neighbor.
- In the iterative method, we use a stack to keep track of the nodes to visit next, processing each node by popping it from the stack.

You can choose either method based on your preference or the specific requirements of your application.

Question 5: What is the approach to find the length of the longest contiguous subarray with a sum equal to zero?
Answer: To find the length of the longest contiguous subarray with a sum equal to zero, you can use a hash map (dictionary in Python) to store the cumulative sums and their corresponding indices. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the cumulative sum and a variable to store the maximum length of the subarray found.
2. Create a hash map to store the cumulative sum as the key and the index as the value.
3. Iterate through the array, updating the cumulative sum at each index.
4. For each cumulative sum:
   - If the cumulative sum is zero, update the maximum length to the current index + 1 (since the subarray starts from index 0).
   - If the cumulative sum has been seen before (exists in the hash map), calculate the length of the subarray from the previous index of that cumulative sum to the current index. Update the maximum length if this new length is greater.
   - If the cumulative sum has not been seen before, store it in the hash map with the current index.

Here is a sample implementation in Python:

```python
def max_len_zero_sum_subarray(arr):
    cum_sum = 0
    max_length = 0
    sum_index_map = {}

    for i in range(len(arr)):
        cum_sum += arr[i]

        if cum_sum == 0:
            max_length = i + 1  # Subarray from index 0 to i

        if cum_sum in sum_index_map:
            # Calculate the length of the subarray
            length = i - sum_index_map[cum_sum]
            max_length = max(max_length, length)
        else:
            # Store the index of the first occurrence of this cumulative sum
            sum_index_map[cum_sum] = i

    return max_length
```

This approach runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the array, and it uses O(n) space for the hash map.

Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. As a rule of thumb, guide me through beginner problems, followed by interview level problems, followed by competitive programming problems. The latter 2 levels can involve concepts from data structures and algorithms.
2) Please be very specific about what skills I need to learn.
3) Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for problems which I have not solved yet. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) The task should involve writing a main Python function that at most use basic libraries (try not to import too many or too advanced modules)
7) Do not give tasks that require file operations (create, read, update, delete) or an internet connection.
8) I am only allowed to write Python functions, so do not require me to write other things (e.g. objects). 
9) Requiring me to write a function that takes in an object and uses object methods is still ok, but I cannot define the objects myself. You must provide the objects as input to my function in the assert statement.

Take note of these in your response:
1) Give an expected function name for the task.
2) Give a tuple of 3 assert statements that tests the function's correctness in the "test_tuple" field. This must strictly contain single-line assert statements only; any setup code for the test must be filled in the "test_setup_code" field.
3) The function name which you gave must be called in the assert statements. 

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}

INFO - [Task id] 95 [prompt] Question 1: How do you implement a queue using a list in Python?
Answer: You can implement a queue using a list in Python by utilizing the `append()` method to add elements to the end of the list and the `pop(0)` method to remove elements from the front of the list. Here is a simple example:

```python
class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.queue = []

    def enqueue(self, item):
        self.queue.append(item)

    def dequeue(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.queue.pop(0)
        else:
            raise IndexError("dequeue from an empty queue")

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.queue) == 0

    def size(self):
        return len(self.queue)

# Example usage:
q = Queue()
q.enqueue(1)
q.enqueue(2)
q.enqueue(3)
print(q.dequeue())  # Output: 1
print(q.size())     # Output: 2
```

In this implementation:
- `enqueue` adds an item to the end of the queue.
- `dequeue` removes and returns the item from the front of the queue.
- `is_empty` checks if the queue is empty.
- `size` returns the number of items in the queue. 

Keep in mind that using a list for a queue can be inefficient for large queues because `pop(0)` has a time complexity of O(n). For better performance, consider using `collections.deque`, which is optimized for fast appends and pops from both ends.

Question 2: What is the best way to find the maximum product of any two integers in a list?
Answer: The best way to find the maximum product of any two integers in a list is to first identify the two largest integers in the list. You can do this efficiently in a single pass through the list. Here’s a simple approach:

1. Initialize two variables, `max1` and `max2`, to hold the largest and second largest integers, respectively.
2. Iterate through the list, updating `max1` and `max2` as you find larger integers.
3. The maximum product will be the product of `max1` and `max2`.

Here’s a sample implementation in Python:

```python
def max_product(nums):
    if len(nums) < 2:
        raise ValueError("At least two numbers are required")
    
    max1 = max2 = float('-inf')
    
    for num in nums:
        if num > max1:
            max2 = max1
            max1 = num
        elif num > max2:
            max2 = num
            
    return max1 * max2

# Example usage:
numbers = [3, 5, 1, 2, 4]
result = max_product(numbers)
print(result)  # Output: 20 (5 * 4)
```

This method runs in O(n) time complexity, making it efficient for large lists.

Question 3: How do you calculate the sum of all integers that are multiples of a given number in a list?
Answer: To calculate the sum of all integers that are multiples of a given number in a list, you can use a simple loop or a list comprehension in Python. Here’s an example using both methods:

### Using a loop:
```python
def sum_of_multiples(numbers, multiple):
    total = 0
    for number in numbers:
        if number % multiple == 0:
            total += number
    return total

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
multiple = 2
result = sum_of_multiples(numbers, multiple)
print(result)  # Output: 30 (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10)
```

### Using a list comprehension:
```python
def sum_of_multiples(numbers, multiple):
    return sum(number for number in numbers if number % multiple == 0)

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
multiple = 2
result = sum_of_multiples(numbers, multiple)
print(result)  # Output: 30 (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10)
```

In both examples, the function `sum_of_multiples` takes a list of numbers and a specified multiple, then calculates and returns the sum of all numbers in the list that are multiples of the given number.

Question 4: How do you perform a depth-first search (DFS) on a graph represented as an adjacency list?
Answer: To perform a depth-first search (DFS) on a graph represented as an adjacency list, you can use either a recursive approach or an iterative approach using a stack. Below is an example of both methods in Python.

### Graph Representation
First, let's assume the graph is represented as an adjacency list using a dictionary:

```python
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['D', 'E'],
    'C': ['F'],
    'D': [],
    'E': ['F'],
    'F': []
}
```

### Recursive DFS
Here is how you can implement DFS recursively:

```python
def dfs_recursive(node, visited):
    if node not in visited:
        print(node)  # Process the node (e.g., print it)
        visited.add(node)  # Mark the node as visited
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            dfs_recursive(neighbor, visited)

visited = set()
dfs_recursive('A', visited)
```

### Iterative DFS
Here is how you can implement DFS iteratively using a stack:

```python
def dfs_iterative(start):
    visited = set()
    stack = [start]

    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        if node not in visited:
            print(node)  # Process the node (e.g., print it)
            visited.add(node)  # Mark the node as visited
            # Add neighbors to the stack (reverse order to maintain correct order)
            stack.extend(reversed(graph[node]))

dfs_iterative('A')
```

### Explanation
- In both methods, we maintain a set called `visited` to keep track of the nodes that have already been processed.
- In the recursive method, we call the function recursively for each unvisited neighbor.
- In the iterative method, we use a stack to keep track of the nodes to visit next, processing each node by popping it from the stack.

You can choose either method based on your preference or the specific requirements of your application.

Question 5: What is the approach to find the length of the longest contiguous subarray with a sum equal to zero?
Answer: To find the length of the longest contiguous subarray with a sum equal to zero, you can use a hash map (dictionary in Python) to store the cumulative sums and their corresponding indices. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the cumulative sum and a variable to store the maximum length of the subarray found.
2. Create a hash map to store the cumulative sum as the key and the index as the value.
3. Iterate through the array, updating the cumulative sum at each index.
4. For each cumulative sum:
   - If the cumulative sum is zero, update the maximum length to the current index + 1 (since the subarray starts from index 0).
   - If the cumulative sum has been seen before (exists in the hash map), calculate the length of the subarray from the previous index of that cumulative sum to the current index. Update the maximum length if this new length is greater.
   - If the cumulative sum has not been seen before, store it in the hash map with the current index.

Here is a sample implementation in Python:

```python
def max_len_zero_sum_subarray(arr):
    cum_sum = 0
    max_length = 0
    sum_index_map = {}

    for i in range(len(arr)):
        cum_sum += arr[i]

        if cum_sum == 0:
            max_length = i + 1  # Subarray from index 0 to i

        if cum_sum in sum_index_map:
            # Calculate the length of the subarray
            length = i - sum_index_map[cum_sum]
            max_length = max(max_length, length)
        else:
            # Store the index of the first occurrence of this cumulative sum
            sum_index_map[cum_sum] = i

    return max_length
```

This approach runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the array, and it uses O(n) space for the hash map.

You are a helpful assistant that tells me the next immediate task (in the form of a function) to do for Python programming. 
My ultimate goal is to solve as many diverse problems as possible and become the best programmer in the world.

I will give you the following information:

Question 3: ...
Answer: ...

Completed tasks so far: ...
Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. As a rule of thumb, guide me through beginner problems, followed by interview level problems, followed by competitive programming problems. The latter 2 levels can involve concepts from data structures and algorithms.
2) Please be very specific about what skills I need to learn.
3) Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for problems which I have not solved yet. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) The task should involve writing a main Python function that at most use basic libraries (try not to import too many or too advanced modules)
7) Do not give tasks that require file operations (create, read, update, delete) or an internet connection.
8) I am only allowed to write Python functions, so do not require me to write other things (e.g. objects). 
9) Requiring me to write a function that takes in an object and uses object methods is still ok, but I cannot define the objects myself. You must provide the objects as input to my function in the assert statement.

Take note of these in your response:
1) Give an expected function name for the task.
2) Give a tuple of 3 assert statements that tests the function's correctness in the "test_tuple" field. This must strictly contain single-line assert statements only; any setup code for the test must be filled in the "test_setup_code" field.
3) The function name which you gave must be called in the assert statements. 

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

INFO - [Task id] 95 [prompt] Question 1: How do you implement a queue using a list in Python?
Answer: You can implement a queue using a list in Python by utilizing the `append()` method to add elements to the end of the list and the `pop(0)` method to remove elements from the front of the list. Here is a simple example:

```python
class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.queue = []

    def enqueue(self, item):
        self.queue.append(item)

    def dequeue(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.queue.pop(0)
        else:
            raise IndexError("dequeue from an empty queue")

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.queue) == 0

    def size(self):
        return len(self.queue)

# Example usage:
q = Queue()
q.enqueue(1)
q.enqueue(2)
q.enqueue(3)
print(q.dequeue())  # Output: 1
print(q.size())     # Output: 2
```

In this implementation:
- `enqueue` adds an item to the end of the queue.
- `dequeue` removes and returns the item from the front of the queue.
- `is_empty` checks if the queue is empty.
- `size` returns the number of items in the queue. 

Keep in mind that using a list for a queue can be inefficient for large queues because `pop(0)` has a time complexity of O(n). For better performance, consider using `collections.deque`, which is optimized for fast appends and pops from both ends.

Question 2: What is the best way to find the maximum product of any two integers in a list?
Answer: The best way to find the maximum product of any two integers in a list is to first identify the two largest integers in the list. You can do this efficiently in a single pass through the list. Here’s a simple approach:

1. Initialize two variables, `max1` and `max2`, to hold the largest and second largest integers, respectively.
2. Iterate through the list, updating `max1` and `max2` as you find larger integers.
3. The maximum product will be the product of `max1` and `max2`.

Here’s a sample implementation in Python:

```python
def max_product(nums):
    if len(nums) < 2:
        raise ValueError("At least two numbers are required")
    
    max1 = max2 = float('-inf')
    
    for num in nums:
        if num > max1:
            max2 = max1
            max1 = num
        elif num > max2:
            max2 = num
            
    return max1 * max2

# Example usage:
numbers = [3, 5, 1, 2, 4]
result = max_product(numbers)
print(result)  # Output: 20 (5 * 4)
```

This method runs in O(n) time complexity, making it efficient for large lists.

Question 3: How do you calculate the sum of all integers that are multiples of a given number in a list?
Answer: To calculate the sum of all integers that are multiples of a given number in a list, you can use a simple loop or a list comprehension in Python. Here’s an example using both methods:

### Using a loop:
```python
def sum_of_multiples(numbers, multiple):
    total = 0
    for number in numbers:
        if number % multiple == 0:
            total += number
    return total

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
multiple = 2
result = sum_of_multiples(numbers, multiple)
print(result)  # Output: 30 (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10)
```

### Using a list comprehension:
```python
def sum_of_multiples(numbers, multiple):
    return sum(number for number in numbers if number % multiple == 0)

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
multiple = 2
result = sum_of_multiples(numbers, multiple)
print(result)  # Output: 30 (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10)
```

In both examples, the function `sum_of_multiples` takes a list of numbers and a specified multiple, then calculates and returns the sum of all numbers in the list that are multiples of the given number.

Question 4: How do you perform a depth-first search (DFS) on a graph represented as an adjacency list?
Answer: To perform a depth-first search (DFS) on a graph represented as an adjacency list, you can use either a recursive approach or an iterative approach using a stack. Below is an example of both methods in Python.

### Graph Representation
First, let's assume the graph is represented as an adjacency list using a dictionary:

```python
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['D', 'E'],
    'C': ['F'],
    'D': [],
    'E': ['F'],
    'F': []
}
```

### Recursive DFS
Here is how you can implement DFS recursively:

```python
def dfs_recursive(node, visited):
    if node not in visited:
        print(node)  # Process the node (e.g., print it)
        visited.add(node)  # Mark the node as visited
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            dfs_recursive(neighbor, visited)

visited = set()
dfs_recursive('A', visited)
```

### Iterative DFS
Here is how you can implement DFS iteratively using a stack:

```python
def dfs_iterative(start):
    visited = set()
    stack = [start]

    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        if node not in visited:
            print(node)  # Process the node (e.g., print it)
            visited.add(node)  # Mark the node as visited
            # Add neighbors to the stack (reverse order to maintain correct order)
            stack.extend(reversed(graph[node]))

dfs_iterative('A')
```

### Explanation
- In both methods, we maintain a set called `visited` to keep track of the nodes that have already been processed.
- In the recursive method, we call the function recursively for each unvisited neighbor.
- In the iterative method, we use a stack to keep track of the nodes to visit next, processing each node by popping it from the stack.

You can choose either method based on your preference or the specific requirements of your application.

Question 5: What is the approach to find the length of the longest contiguous subarray with a sum equal to zero?
Answer: To find the length of the longest contiguous subarray with a sum equal to zero, you can use a hash map (dictionary in Python) to store the cumulative sums and their corresponding indices. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the cumulative sum and a variable to store the maximum length of the subarray found.
2. Create a hash map to store the cumulative sum as the key and the index as the value.
3. Iterate through the array, updating the cumulative sum at each index.
4. For each cumulative sum:
   - If the cumulative sum is zero, update the maximum length to the current index + 1 (since the subarray starts from index 0).
   - If the cumulative sum has been seen before (exists in the hash map), calculate the length of the subarray from the previous index of that cumulative sum to the current index. Update the maximum length if this new length is greater.
   - If the cumulative sum has not been seen before, store it in the hash map with the current index.

Here is a sample implementation in Python:

```python
def max_len_zero_sum_subarray(arr):
    cum_sum = 0
    max_length = 0
    sum_index_map = {}

    for i in range(len(arr)):
        cum_sum += arr[i]

        if cum_sum == 0:
            max_length = i + 1  # Subarray from index 0 to i

        if cum_sum in sum_index_map:
            # Calculate the length of the subarray
            length = i - sum_index_map[cum_sum]
            max_length = max(max_length, length)
        else:
            # Store the index of the first occurrence of this cumulative sum
            sum_index_map[cum_sum] = i

    return max_length
```

This approach runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the array, and it uses O(n) space for the hash map.

You are a helpful assistant that tells me the next immediate task (in the form of a function) to do for Python programming.

Completed tasks so far: ...
Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. As a rule of thumb, guide me through beginner problems, followed by interview level problems, followed by competitive programming problems. The latter 2 levels can involve concepts from data structures and algorithms.
2) Please be very specific about what skills I need to learn.
3) Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for problems which I have not solved yet. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) The task should involve writing a main Python function that at most use basic libraries (try not to import too many or too advanced modules)
7) Do not give tasks that require file operations (create, read, update, delete) or an internet connection.
8) I am only allowed to write Python functions, so do not require me to write other things (e.g. objects). 
9) Requiring me to write a function that takes in an object and uses object methods is still ok, but I cannot define the objects myself. You must provide the objects as input to my function in the assert statement.

Take note of these in your response:
1) Give an expected function name for the task.
2) Give a tuple of 3 assert statements that tests the function's correctness in the "test_tuple" field. This must strictly contain single-line assert statements only; any setup code for the test must be filled in the "test_setup_code" field.
3) The function name which you gave must be called in the assert statements. 

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}

INFO - [Task id] 95 [prompt] Question 1: How do you implement a queue using a list in Python?
Answer: You can implement a queue using a list in Python by utilizing the `append()` method to add elements to the end of the list and the `pop(0)` method to remove elements from the front of the list. Here is a simple example:

```python
class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.queue = []

    def enqueue(self, item):
        self.queue.append(item)

    def dequeue(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.queue.pop(0)
        else:
            raise IndexError("dequeue from an empty queue")

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.queue) == 0

    def size(self):
        return len(self.queue)

# Example usage:
q = Queue()
q.enqueue(1)
q.enqueue(2)
q.enqueue(3)
print(q.dequeue())  # Output: 1
print(q.size())     # Output: 2
```

In this implementation:
- `enqueue` adds an item to the end of the queue.
- `dequeue` removes and returns the item from the front of the queue.
- `is_empty` checks if the queue is empty.
- `size` returns the number of items in the queue. 

Keep in mind that using a list for a queue can be inefficient for large queues because `pop(0)` has a time complexity of O(n). For better performance, consider using `collections.deque`, which is optimized for fast appends and pops from both ends.

Question 2: What is the best way to find the maximum product of any two integers in a list?
Answer: The best way to find the maximum product of any two integers in a list is to first identify the two largest integers in the list. You can do this efficiently in a single pass through the list. Here’s a simple approach:

1. Initialize two variables, `max1` and `max2`, to hold the largest and second largest integers, respectively.
2. Iterate through the list, updating `max1` and `max2` as you find larger integers.
3. The maximum product will be the product of `max1` and `max2`.

Here’s a sample implementation in Python:

```python
def max_product(nums):
    if len(nums) < 2:
        raise ValueError("At least two numbers are required")
    
    max1 = max2 = float('-inf')
    
    for num in nums:
        if num > max1:
            max2 = max1
            max1 = num
        elif num > max2:
            max2 = num
            
    return max1 * max2

# Example usage:
numbers = [3, 5, 1, 2, 4]
result = max_product(numbers)
print(result)  # Output: 20 (5 * 4)
```

This method runs in O(n) time complexity, making it efficient for large lists.

Question 3: How do you calculate the sum of all integers that are multiples of a given number in a list?
Answer: To calculate the sum of all integers that are multiples of a given number in a list, you can use a simple loop or a list comprehension in Python. Here’s an example using both methods:

### Using a loop:
```python
def sum_of_multiples(numbers, multiple):
    total = 0
    for number in numbers:
        if number % multiple == 0:
            total += number
    return total

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
multiple = 2
result = sum_of_multiples(numbers, multiple)
print(result)  # Output: 30 (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10)
```

### Using a list comprehension:
```python
def sum_of_multiples(numbers, multiple):
    return sum(number for number in numbers if number % multiple == 0)

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
multiple = 2
result = sum_of_multiples(numbers, multiple)
print(result)  # Output: 30 (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10)
```

In both examples, the function `sum_of_multiples` takes a list of numbers and a specified multiple, then calculates and returns the sum of all numbers in the list that are multiples of the given number.

Question 4: How do you perform a depth-first search (DFS) on a graph represented as an adjacency list?
Answer: To perform a depth-first search (DFS) on a graph represented as an adjacency list, you can use either a recursive approach or an iterative approach using a stack. Below is an example of both methods in Python.

### Graph Representation
First, let's assume the graph is represented as an adjacency list using a dictionary:

```python
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['D', 'E'],
    'C': ['F'],
    'D': [],
    'E': ['F'],
    'F': []
}
```

### Recursive DFS
Here is how you can implement DFS recursively:

```python
def dfs_recursive(node, visited):
    if node not in visited:
        print(node)  # Process the node (e.g., print it)
        visited.add(node)  # Mark the node as visited
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            dfs_recursive(neighbor, visited)

visited = set()
dfs_recursive('A', visited)
```

### Iterative DFS
Here is how you can implement DFS iteratively using a stack:

```python
def dfs_iterative(start):
    visited = set()
    stack = [start]

    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        if node not in visited:
            print(node)  # Process the node (e.g., print it)
            visited.add(node)  # Mark the node as visited
            # Add neighbors to the stack (reverse order to maintain correct order)
            stack.extend(reversed(graph[node]))

dfs_iterative('A')
```

### Explanation
- In both methods, we maintain a set called `visited` to keep track of the nodes that have already been processed.
- In the recursive method, we call the function recursively for each unvisited neighbor.
- In the iterative method, we use a stack to keep track of the nodes to visit next, processing each node by popping it from the stack.

You can choose either method based on your preference or the specific requirements of your application.

Question 5: What is the approach to find the length of the longest contiguous subarray with a sum equal to zero?
Answer: To find the length of the longest contiguous subarray with a sum equal to zero, you can use a hash map (dictionary in Python) to store the cumulative sums and their corresponding indices. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the cumulative sum and a variable to store the maximum length of the subarray found.
2. Create a hash map to store the cumulative sum as the key and the index as the value.
3. Iterate through the array, updating the cumulative sum at each index.
4. For each cumulative sum:
   - If the cumulative sum is zero, update the maximum length to the current index + 1 (since the subarray starts from index 0).
   - If the cumulative sum has been seen before (exists in the hash map), calculate the length of the subarray from the previous index of that cumulative sum to the current index. Update the maximum length if this new length is greater.
   - If the cumulative sum has not been seen before, store it in the hash map with the current index.

Here is a sample implementation in Python:

```python
def max_len_zero_sum_subarray(arr):
    cum_sum = 0
    max_length = 0
    sum_index_map = {}

    for i in range(len(arr)):
        cum_sum += arr[i]

        if cum_sum == 0:
            max_length = i + 1  # Subarray from index 0 to i

        if cum_sum in sum_index_map:
            # Calculate the length of the subarray
            length = i - sum_index_map[cum_sum]
            max_length = max(max_length, length)
        else:
            # Store the index of the first occurrence of this cumulative sum
            sum_index_map[cum_sum] = i

    return max_length
```

This approach runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the array, and it uses O(n) space for the hash map.
