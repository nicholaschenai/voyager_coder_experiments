[description for function: evaluate_infix_expression]
This function evaluates a given infix mathematical expression represented as a string. It first tokenizes the expression into numbers and operators using regular expressions. It then uses two stacks, one for numbers and another for operators, to process the tokens according to the rules of operator precedence and parentheses. As it encounters tokens, it applies operators when necessary and manages the stacks accordingly. Finally, it returns the result of the evaluated expression as an integer. The function effectively handles basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
