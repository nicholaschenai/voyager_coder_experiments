[description for function: find_gcd_of_list]
This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a list of numbers by iteratively applying the GCD calculation to each element in the list, starting with the first number as the initial GCD. If the input list is empty, it returns None. It initializes the current GCD with the first number and then updates it by finding the GCD with each subsequent number in the list. Finally, it returns the computed GCD for the entire list.
