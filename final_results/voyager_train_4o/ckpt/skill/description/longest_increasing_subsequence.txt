[description for function: longest_increasing_subsequence]
This function calculates the length of the longest increasing subsequence in a given list of numbers. It initializes a dynamic programming array to keep track of the longest subsequence lengths at each index. The function iterates through the list, comparing each element with the previous ones to update the lengths accordingly. If a number is greater than a previous number, it updates the current index's value based on the maximum length found. Finally, it returns the maximum value from the dynamic programming array, representing the length of the longest increasing subsequence. If the input list is empty, it returns 0.
