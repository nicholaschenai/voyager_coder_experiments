[description for function: in_order_traversal]
This function performs an in-order traversal of a binary tree represented as a list, returning the values in a list format. It first checks if the tree is empty, returning an empty list if so. The root of the tree is identified as the first element, while the left and right subtrees are determined based on the subsequent elements. It recursively traverses the left subtree, appends the root value, and then traverses the right subtree. The results from these traversals are concatenated to produce the final output. This effectively yields the nodes of the tree in in-order sequence.
