[description for function: max_subarray_sum]
This function calculates the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within a given list of integers. It initializes two variables to track the maximum sum found and the current sum of the subarray being evaluated. As it iterates through the array, it updates the current sum by either starting a new subarray with the current number or adding the current number to the existing sum. It simultaneously updates the maximum sum if the current sum exceeds the previously recorded maximum. The function returns the highest sum found after evaluating all elements in the array. If the input array is empty, it returns 0.
