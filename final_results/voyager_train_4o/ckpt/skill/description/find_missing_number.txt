[description for function: find_missing_number]
This function calculates the missing number from a sequence of integers ranging from 1 to n, where n is the length of the input list plus one. It first determines the expected sum of the complete sequence using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers. Then, it computes the actual sum of the numbers present in the input list. By subtracting the actual sum from the expected sum, it identifies the missing number. Finally, the function returns this missing number as the output.
