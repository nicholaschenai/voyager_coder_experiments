[description for function: preorder_traversal]
This function performs a preorder traversal of a binary tree represented as a list, returning a list of the node values in the order they are visited. It starts by checking if the tree is empty, in which case it returns an empty list. If the tree is not empty, it identifies the root node and recursively processes the left and right subtrees. The results from the left and right traversals are combined with the root node to form the final output. The function effectively captures the preorder traversal sequence by visiting the root before its subtrees. The output is a flattened list of node values in preorder order.
