[description for function: calculate_lcm]
This function computes the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of numbers. If the input list is empty, it returns None. It utilizes the reduce function to apply the LCM calculation iteratively across the list. The LCM is determined by using the absolute product of the numbers divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The function effectively handles multiple numbers, returning the overall LCM.
