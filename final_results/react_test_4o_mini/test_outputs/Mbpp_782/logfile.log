Write a python function to find the sum of all odd length subarrays. 
assert odd_length_sum([1,2,4]) == 14
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/782 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the sum of all odd-length subarrays in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand Subarrays**: A subarray is a contiguous part of an array. For example, for the array `[1, 2, 4]`, the subarrays are `[1]`, `[2]`, `[4]`, `[1, 2]`, `[2, 4]`, and `[1, 2, 4]`.

2. **Identify Odd-Length Subarrays**: An odd-length subarray is one that has a length of 1, 3, 5, etc. For the array `[1, 2, 4]`, the odd-length subarrays are `[1]`, `[2]`, `[4]`, and `[1, 2, 4]`.

3. **Iterate Through the Array**: You can use nested loops to generate all possible subarrays. The outer loop can iterate over the starting index of the subarray, and the inner loop can iterate over the ending index.

4. **Check Length**: For each subarray generated, check if its length is odd. If it is, add its sum to a cumulative total.

5. **Return the Total Sum**: After iterating through all possible subarrays, return the total sum of the odd-length subarrays.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def odd_length_sum(arr):
    total_sum = 0
    n = len(arr)
    
    # Iterate over all possible starting points
    for start in range(n):
        # Iterate over all possible ending points
        for end in range(start, n):
            # Calculate the length of the subarray
            length = end - start + 1
            # Check if the length is odd
            if length % 2 == 1:
                # Add the sum of the subarray to the total sum
                total_sum += sum(arr[start:end + 1])
    
    return total_sum
```

In this function, `arr[start:end + 1]` generates the subarray, and `sum()` calculates its sum. The function ultimately returns the total sum of all odd-length subarrays. 

This approach ensures that you consider all possible odd-length subarrays and accumulate their sums correctly.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/782 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct and outlines the necessary steps to find the sum of all odd-length subarrays. The code snippet included in the plan is also appropriate for the task. However, it can be optimized to avoid recalculating the sum of subarrays multiple times. Instead of using nested loops to generate subarrays and summing them, we can directly calculate the contribution of each element to the odd-length subarrays.

Plan:
1) Initialize a variable to keep track of the total sum of odd-length subarrays.
2) Determine the length of the input array.
3) Use a loop to iterate through each element in the array.
4) For each element, calculate how many odd-length subarrays it contributes to based on its position.
5) Add the contributions of each element to the total sum.
6) Return the total sum.

Code:
```python
def odd_length_sum(arr):
    total_sum = 0
    n = len(arr)
    
    for i in range(n):
        # Calculate the number of odd-length subarrays that include arr[i]
        total_subarrays = (i + 1) * (n - i)
