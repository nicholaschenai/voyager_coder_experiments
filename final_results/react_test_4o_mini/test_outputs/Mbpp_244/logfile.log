INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/244 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a python function to find the next perfect square greater than a given number.
assert next_Perfect_Square(35) == 36
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/244 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the next perfect square greater than a given number in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand Perfect Squares**: A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer. For example, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, etc., are perfect squares (1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, 6^2, respectively).

2. **Identify the Next Perfect Square**: To find the next perfect square greater than a given number, you can:
   - Calculate the integer square root of the given number. This can be done using the `math.isqrt()` function, which returns the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to the given number.
   - Increment this integer by 1 to get the next integer.
   - Square this incremented integer to get the next perfect square.

3. **Implement the Function**: You can implement this logic in a Python function. The function will take a number as input, perform the calculations described, and return the next perfect square.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
import math

def next_Perfect_Square(n):
    # Step 1: Find the integer square root of n
    root = math.isqrt(n)
    
    # Step 2: Increment the root to get the next integer
    next_root = root + 1
    
    # Step 3: Return the square of the next integer
    return next_root ** 2
```

4. **Testing the Function**: You can use the provided assertion to test if the function works correctly. For example, `assert next_Perfect_Square(35) == 36` checks if the function returns 36, which is the next perfect square after 35.

By following these steps, you can successfully create a function that finds the next perfect square greater than a given number.

Here are some useful functions written earlier which you can reuse or reference.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

The use of `math.isqrt()` to find the integer square root and then squaring the incremented value is a valid approach. The function name and typing must strictly follow the assertion provided.

Plan:
1) Import the `math` module to use the `isqrt` function.
2) Define the function `next_Perfect_Square` that takes an integer `n` as input.
3) Calculate the integer square root of `n` using `math.isqrt(n)`.
4) Increment the result from step 3 by 1 to get the next integer.
5) Square the incremented integer to find the next perfect square.
