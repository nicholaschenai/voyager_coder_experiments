"""
Write a python function to find the last digit in factorial of a given number.
assert last_Digit_Factorial(4) == 4
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/577 [generation text] Answer: To find the last digit of the factorial of a given number in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand Factorial**: The factorial of a number \( n \) (denoted as \( n! \)) is the product of all positive integers from 1 to \( n \). For example, \( 4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24 \).

2. **Calculate Factorial**: You can calculate the factorial using a loop or recursion. However, since you only need the last digit, you can optimize the calculation by keeping track of the last digit during the multiplication process.

3. **Extract Last Digit**: After calculating the factorial, you can find the last digit by taking the result modulo 10 (i.e., `result % 10`).

4. **Function Implementation**: Create a function that takes an integer as input, calculates the factorial while keeping track of the last digit, and returns that last digit.

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def last_Digit_Factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1  # 0! and 1! both equal 1
    last_digit = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        last_digit = (last_digit * i) % 10  # Keep only the last digit
    return last_digit

# Example usage
assert last_Digit_Factorial(4) == 4  # 4! = 24, last digit is 4
```

This function efficiently computes the last digit of the factorial without needing to calculate the entire factorial value, which can become very large for larger numbers.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To find the last digit of the factorial of a given number in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand Factorial**: The factorial of a number \( n \) (denoted as \( n! \)) is the product of all positive integers from 1 to \( n \). For example, \( 4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24 \).

2. **Calculate Factorial**: You can calculate the factorial using a loop or recursion. However, since you only need the last digit, you can optimize the calculation by keeping track of the last digit during the multiplication process.

3. **Extract Last Digit**: After calculating the factorial, you can find the last digit by taking the result modulo 10 (i.e., `result % 10`).

4. **Function Implementation**: Create a function that takes an integer as input, calculates the factorial while keeping track of the last digit, and returns that last digit.

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def last_Digit_Factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1  # 0! and 1! both equal 1
    last_digit = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        last_digit = (last_digit * i) % 10  # Keep only the last digit
    return last_digit

# Example usage
assert last_Digit_Factorial(4) == 4  # 4! = 24, last digit is 4
```

This function efficiently computes the last digit of the factorial without needing to calculate the entire factorial value, which can become very large for larger numbers.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/577 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct and outlines the necessary steps to find the last digit of a factorial. The implementation correctly calculates the last digit by maintaining only the last digit during the multiplication process, which is efficient. The assertion provided in the task will pass as the function is designed to return the last digit of the factorial.

Plan:
1) Define the function `last_Digit_Factorial` that takes an integer `n` as input.
2) Handle the base cases where `n` is 0 or 1, returning 1 since both 0! and 1! equal 1.
3) Initialize a variable to keep track of the last digit of the factorial.
4) Use a loop to multiply numbers from 2 to `n`, updating the last digit at each step by taking the result modulo 10.
5) Return the last digit after the loop completes.

Code:
```python
def last_Digit_Factorial(n: int) -> int:
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1  # 0! and 1! both equal 1
    last_digit = 1
