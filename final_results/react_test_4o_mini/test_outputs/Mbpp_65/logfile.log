Write a function to flatten a list and sum all of its elements.
assert recursive_list_sum(([1, 2, [3,4],[5,6]]))==21
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/65 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of flattening a list and summing all of its elements in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `recursive_list_sum` that takes a list as an argument.

2. **Initialize a Sum Variable**: Inside the function, initialize a variable to keep track of the total sum of the elements.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to iterate through each element in the list.

4. **Check Element Type**: For each element, check if it is a list itself. If it is, you will need to call the function recursively on that sublist to flatten it and sum its elements.

5. **Add to Sum**: If the element is not a list (i.e., it is a number), add it directly to the sum variable.

6. **Return the Total Sum**: After iterating through all elements, return the total sum.

Here is a conceptual example of how the function might look in code:

```python
def recursive_list_sum(lst):
    total_sum = 0
    for element in lst:
        if isinstance(element, list):
            total_sum += recursive_list_sum(element)  # Recursive call for sublist
        else:
            total_sum += element  # Add the number to the sum
    return total_sum
```

With this function, calling `recursive_list_sum([1, 2, [3, 4], [5, 6]])` would correctly return `21`, as it flattens the list and sums all the elements.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

"""
Write a function to flatten a list and sum all of its elements.
assert recursive_list_sum(([1, 2, [3,4],[5,6]]))==21
"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of flattening a list and summing all of its elements in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `recursive_list_sum` that takes a list as an argument.

2. **Initialize a Sum Variable**: Inside the function, initialize a variable to keep track of the total sum of the elements.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to iterate through each element in the list.

4. **Check Element Type**: For each element, check if it is a list itself. If it is, you will need to call the function recursively on that sublist to flatten it and sum its elements.

5. **Add to Sum**: If the element is not a list (i.e., it is a number), add it directly to the sum variable.

6. **Return the Total Sum**: After iterating through all elements, return the total sum.

Here is a conceptual example of how the function might look in code:

```python
def recursive_list_sum(lst):
    total_sum = 0
    for element in lst:
        if isinstance(element, list):
            total_sum += recursive_list_sum(element)  # Recursive call for sublist
        else:
            total_sum += element  # Add the number to the sum
    return total_sum
```

With this function, calling `recursive_list_sum([1, 2, [3, 4], [5, 6]])` would correctly return `21`, as it flattens the list and sums all the elements.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/65 [generation text] Explain: The provided plan is well-structured and outlines the necessary steps to create a function that flattens a list and sums its elements. The conceptual example given in the plan is also correct and follows the required logic. There are no missing steps, and the code should complete the task as specified.

Plan:
1) Define the function `recursive_list_sum` that takes a list as an argument.
2) Initialize a variable `total_sum` to zero to keep track of the sum of the elements.
3) Iterate through each element in the input list.
4) Check if the current element is a list. If it is, call `recursive_list_sum` recursively on that element and add the result to `total_sum`.
5) If the element is not a list, add its value directly to `total_sum`.
6) Return the `total_sum` after processing all elements.
