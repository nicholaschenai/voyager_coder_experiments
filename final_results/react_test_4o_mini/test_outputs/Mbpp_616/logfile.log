Write a function which takes two tuples of the same length and performs the element wise modulo.

"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/616 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of performing element-wise modulo on two tuples of the same length in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function that takes two tuples as arguments.

2. **Check Lengths**: Ensure that both tuples have the same length. If they do not, you can raise an error or handle it as needed.

3. **Iterate Over Elements**: Use a loop or a comprehension to iterate over the elements of both tuples simultaneously. You can use the `zip()` function to pair elements from both tuples.

4. **Perform Modulo Operation**: For each pair of elements, apply the modulo operation (using the `%` operator) to get the remainder of the division of the first element by the second.

5. **Collect Results**: Store the results of the modulo operations in a new tuple.

6. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the new tuple containing the results.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def tuple_modulo(tuple1, tuple2):
    # Check if both tuples have the same length
    if len(tuple1) != len(tuple2):
        raise ValueError("Tuples must be of the same length")
    
    # Perform element-wise modulo using a tuple comprehension
    result = tuple(a % b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
    
    return result
```

This function will take two tuples, perform the modulo operation on each corresponding pair of elements, and return a new tuple with the results. The provided assertion can be used to test the function.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of performing element-wise modulo on two tuples of the same length in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function that takes two tuples as arguments.

2. **Check Lengths**: Ensure that both tuples have the same length. If they do not, you can raise an error or handle it as needed.

3. **Iterate Over Elements**: Use a loop or a comprehension to iterate over the elements of both tuples simultaneously. You can use the `zip()` function to pair elements from both tuples.

4. **Perform Modulo Operation**: For each pair of elements, apply the modulo operation (using the `%` operator) to get the remainder of the division of the first element by the second.

5. **Collect Results**: Store the results of the modulo operations in a new tuple.

6. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the new tuple containing the results.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def tuple_modulo(tuple1, tuple2):
    # Check if both tuples have the same length
    if len(tuple1) != len(tuple2):
        raise ValueError("Tuples must be of the same length")
    
    # Perform element-wise modulo using a tuple comprehension
    result = tuple(a % b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
    
    return result
```

This function will take two tuples, perform the modulo operation on each corresponding pair of elements, and return a new tuple with the results. The provided assertion can be used to test the function.
