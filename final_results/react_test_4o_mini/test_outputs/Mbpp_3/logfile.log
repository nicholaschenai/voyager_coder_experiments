"""
Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
assert is_not_prime(2) == False
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/3 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of identifying non-prime numbers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `is_not_prime` that takes an integer as an argument.

2. **Handle Edge Cases**: Check for edge cases where numbers less than 2 (like 0 and 1) are not prime. You can return `True` for these cases since they are non-prime.

3. **Check for Primality**: For numbers greater than or equal to 2, you need to determine if the number is prime. A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself. You can do this by checking divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.

4. **Return the Result**: If the number is found to be divisible by any number in the range, it is non-prime, and you should return `True`. If it is not divisible by any of those numbers, return `False`.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True  # 0 and 1 are not prime
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True  # Found a divisor, so n is not prime
    return False  # No divisors found, so n is prime
```

In this function, `is_not_prime(2)` would return `False`, as 2 is a prime number.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of identifying non-prime numbers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `is_not_prime` that takes an integer as an argument.

2. **Handle Edge Cases**: Check for edge cases where numbers less than 2 (like 0 and 1) are not prime. You can return `True` for these cases since they are non-prime.

3. **Check for Primality**: For numbers greater than or equal to 2, you need to determine if the number is prime. A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself. You can do this by checking divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.

4. **Return the Result**: If the number is found to be divisible by any number in the range, it is non-prime, and you should return `True`. If it is not divisible by any of those numbers, return `False`.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True  # 0 and 1 are not prime
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True  # Found a divisor, so n is not prime
    return False  # No divisors found, so n is prime
```

In this function, `is_not_prime(2)` would return `False`, as 2 is a prime number.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/3 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct and outlines the necessary steps to identify non-prime numbers. However, it is important to ensure that the function strictly adheres to the specified function name and typings. The plan correctly identifies that numbers less than 2 are non-prime and that the function should return `True` for those cases. The logic for checking divisibility is also sound.

Plan:
1) Define the function `is_not_prime` that takes an integer `n` as an argument.
2) Check if `n` is less than 2. If it is, return `True` since numbers less than 2 are non-prime.
3) For numbers greater than or equal to 2, check for divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n`.
4) If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, return `True` (indicating it is non-prime). If no divisors are found, return `False` (indicating it is prime).

Code:
```python
def is_not_prime(n: int) -> bool:
    if n < 2:
        return True  # 0 and 1 are not prime
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True  # Found a divisor, so n is not prime
    return False  # No divisors found, so n is prime
