"""
Write a function to that returns true if the input string contains sequences of lowercase letters joined with an underscore and false otherwise.
assert text_lowercase_underscore("aab_cbbbc")==(True)
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/16 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of checking if an input string contains sequences of lowercase letters joined with an underscore, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function that takes a string as an argument.

2. **Use Regular Expressions**: Utilize the `re` module in Python, which provides support for regular expressions. This will allow you to define a pattern that matches the desired format.

3. **Define the Pattern**: The pattern should match one or more lowercase letters followed by an underscore and then followed by one or more lowercase letters. You can use the following regex pattern:
   - `^[a-z]+(_[a-z]+)*$`
   - Here, `^` asserts the start of the string, `[a-z]+` matches one or more lowercase letters, `(_[a-z]+)*` matches zero or more occurrences of an underscore followed by one or more lowercase letters, and `$` asserts the end of the string.

4. **Check the Match**: Use the `re.fullmatch()` function to check if the entire string matches the defined pattern.

5. **Return the Result**: Return `True` if there is a match, and `False` otherwise.

Here is a conceptual implementation of the function:

```python
import re

def text_lowercase_underscore(s):
    pattern = r'^[a-z]+(_[a-z]+)*$'
    return re.fullmatch(pattern, s) is not None
```

This function will return `True` for strings that match the specified format and `False` for those that do not. The provided assertion can be used to test the function.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

Write a function to that returns true if the input string contains sequences of lowercase letters joined with an underscore and false otherwise.

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of checking if an input string contains sequences of lowercase letters joined with an underscore, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function that takes a string as an argument.

2. **Use Regular Expressions**: Utilize the `re` module in Python, which provides support for regular expressions. This will allow you to define a pattern that matches the desired format.

3. **Define the Pattern**: The pattern should match one or more lowercase letters followed by an underscore and then followed by one or more lowercase letters. You can use the following regex pattern:
   - `^[a-z]+(_[a-z]+)*$`
   - Here, `^` asserts the start of the string, `[a-z]+` matches one or more lowercase letters, `(_[a-z]+)*` matches zero or more occurrences of an underscore followed by one or more lowercase letters, and `$` asserts the end of the string.

4. **Check the Match**: Use the `re.fullmatch()` function to check if the entire string matches the defined pattern.

5. **Return the Result**: Return `True` if there is a match, and `False` otherwise.

Here is a conceptual implementation of the function:

```python
import re

def text_lowercase_underscore(s):
    pattern = r'^[a-z]+(_[a-z]+)*$'
    return re.fullmatch(pattern, s) is not None
```

This function will return `True` for strings that match the specified format and `False` for those that do not. The provided assertion can be used to test the function.

The use of regular expressions is appropriate for this task, and the provided regex pattern accurately captures the requirement of sequences of lowercase letters joined by underscores.
