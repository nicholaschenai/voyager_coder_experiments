"""
Write a function to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence.
assert find_adverb_position("clearly!! we can see the sky")==(0, 7, 'clearly')
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/440 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the first adverb and its position in a given sentence in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `find_adverb_position` that takes a string (the sentence) as an argument.

2. **Tokenization**: Split the sentence into individual words. This can be done using the `split()` method, which will give you a list of words.

3. **Identify Adverbs**: You need a way to identify adverbs. This can be done using a predefined list of common adverbs or by using a natural language processing (NLP) library like `nltk` or `spaCy` that can tag parts of speech.

4. **Iterate Through Words**: Loop through the list of words and check if each word is an adverb. If you find an adverb, note its position (index) in the list.

5. **Return the Result**: Once you find the first adverb, return a tuple containing the starting index of the word, the ending index (which can be calculated as the starting index plus the length of the word), and the adverb itself.

6. **Handle Cases**: Consider edge cases, such as sentences without adverbs, and decide how to handle them (e.g., returning `None` or a specific message).

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def find_adverb_position(sentence):
    # Step 1: Tokenize the sentence
    words = sentence.split()
    
    # Step 2: Define a list of adverbs (or use an NLP library)
    adverbs = {'clearly', 'quickly', 'silently', 'happily'}  # Example adverbs
    
    # Step 3: Iterate through the words
    for index, word in enumerate(words):
        if word in adverbs:
            start_index = sentence.index(word)
            end_index = start_index + len(word)
            return (start_index, end_index, word)
    
    # Step 4: Return None or a specific value if no adverb is found
    return None
```

This function will find the first adverb in the sentence and return its position and the word itself, as shown in the assertion example.

You are a Python programming assistant that assesses my progress of Python programming and provides useful guidance.

I will give you the following information:

[Task]: The objective I need to accomplish.
[Context]: The context of the task. Serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help me on the task, but my priority is to follow instructions in the Task tag.
[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

You should only respond in JSON format as described below:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

4. **Iterate Through Words**: Loop through the list of words and check if each word is an adverb. If you find an adverb, note its position (index) in the list.

5. **Return the Result**: Once you find the first adverb, return a tuple containing the starting index of the word, the ending index (which can be calculated as the starting index plus the length of the word), and the adverb itself.

6. **Handle Cases**: Consider edge cases, such as sentences without adverbs, and decide how to handle them (e.g., returning `None` or a specific message).

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def find_adverb_position(sentence):
    # Step 1: Tokenize the sentence
    words = sentence.split()
    
    # Step 2: Define a list of adverbs (or use an NLP library)
    adverbs = {'clearly', 'quickly', 'silently', 'happily'}  # Example adverbs
    
    # Step 3: Iterate through the words
    for index, word in enumerate(words):
        if word in adverbs:
            start_index = sentence.index(word)
            end_index = start_index + len(word)
            return (start_index, end_index, word)
    
    # Step 4: Return None or a specific value if no adverb is found
    return None
```

This function will find the first adverb in the sentence and return its position and the word itself, as shown in the assertion example.


[Critique]
To fix this issue, you should preprocess the words to remove any punctuation before checking if they are in the set of adverbs. You can use the `str.strip()` method to remove punctuation from each word. Additionally, ensure that the function handles cases where the adverb might be followed by punctuation.


INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/440 [generation text] Explain: The current implementation of the `find_adverb_position` function does not account for punctuation attached to the words. When the function checks if a word is in the set of adverbs, it fails if the word has punctuation (like "clearly!!"). This is why the assertion fails. The function needs to preprocess the words to remove any punctuation before checking for adverbs.

Plan:
1) Define the function `find_adverb_position` that takes a string as input.
2) Split the sentence into individual words using the `split()` method.
3) Define a set of adverbs to check against.
4) Iterate through the list of words, stripping punctuation from each word using `str.strip()`.
5) Check if the cleaned word is in the set of adverbs.
6) If an adverb is found, calculate its starting and ending indices in the original sentence and return them along with the adverb.
7) If no adverb is found, return `None`.

Code:
```python
def find_adverb_position(sentence: str) -> tuple:
    import string
    
    words = sentence.split()
    adverbs = {'clearly', 'quickly', 'silently', 'happily'}
    
    for word in words:
        cleaned_word = word.strip(string.punctuation)  # Remove punctuation
        if cleaned_word in adverbs:
            start_index = sentence.index(cleaned_word)
            end_index = start_index + len(cleaned_word)
            return (start_index, end_index, cleaned_word)
    
    return None
