INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/798 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a python function to find the sum of an array.
assert _sum([1, 2, 3]) == 6
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/798 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of writing a Python function that finds the sum of an array, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function named `_sum` that takes a single parameter, which will be the array (or list) of numbers.

2. **Initialize a Variable**: Inside the function, initialize a variable to hold the cumulative sum. This variable can be set to zero at the beginning.

3. **Iterate Over the Array**: Use a loop to iterate over each element in the array. For each element, add its value to the cumulative sum variable.

4. **Return the Result**: After the loop has completed, return the cumulative sum variable as the result of the function.

5. **Assertion for Testing**: Use an assertion statement to test the function with a sample input, ensuring that the output matches the expected result.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def _sum(array):
    total = 0
    for number in array:
        total += number
    return total

# Test the function
assert _sum([1, 2, 3]) == 6
```

This function will correctly compute the sum of the elements in the provided array.

Here are some useful functions written earlier which you can reuse or reference.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/798 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct and outlines the necessary steps to implement the function. The code implementation also follows the plan and correctly computes the sum of the elements in the array. However, the task requires that the code be presented in a specific format, and the assertion should not be included in the final code.

Plan:
1) Define the function `_sum` that takes a list of numbers as an argument.
2) Initialize a variable `total` to zero to hold the cumulative sum.
3) Use a for loop to iterate over each number in the input list and add each number to `total`.
4) Return the value of `total` after the loop completes.

```python
def _sum(array):
    total = 0

        total += number
    return total
