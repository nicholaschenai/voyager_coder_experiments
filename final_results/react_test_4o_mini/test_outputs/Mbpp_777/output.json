    "reasoning": "The implementation failed the test case because it returned 20 instead of the expected 21. This indicates that the function is not correctly identifying all non-repeated elements in the list.",
    "success": false,
    "critique": "The issue arises from the way the function is summing the non-repeated elements. The current implementation correctly identifies the non-repeated elements, but it seems to be missing the inclusion of the element '6' in the sum. To fix this, ensure that the function correctly sums all elements that appear exactly once, including those at the end of the list. You might want to double-check the logic for summing the elements to ensure that all non-repeated elements are included."
