INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/94 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Given a list of tuples, write a function that returns the first value of the tuple with the smallest second value.
assert index_minimum([('Rash', 143), ('Manjeet', 200), ('Varsha', 100)]) == 'Varsha'
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/94 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the first value of the tuple with the smallest second value in a list of tuples, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function that takes a list of tuples as an argument.

2. **Initialize Variables**: You may want to initialize a variable to keep track of the minimum second value found so far and another variable to store the corresponding first value.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Loop through each tuple in the list. For each tuple, check the second value.

4. **Compare Values**: If the second value of the current tuple is less than the minimum value found so far, update the minimum value and store the first value of that tuple.

5. **Return the Result**: After iterating through all the tuples, return the first value associated with the smallest second value.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def index_minimum(tuples_list):
    # Initialize variables to track the minimum second value and the corresponding first value
    min_value = float('inf')  # Start with infinity
    min_first_value = None
    
    # Iterate through each tuple in the list
    for first, second in tuples_list:
        # Check if the current second value is less than the minimum found so far
        if second < min_value:
            min_value = second  # Update the minimum second value
            min_first_value = first  # Update the corresponding first value
    
    # Return the first value of the tuple with the smallest second value
    return min_first_value
```

This function will correctly return 'Varsha' when called with the provided list of tuples.

Here are some useful functions written earlier which you can reuse or reference.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/94 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided in the context is correct and outlines the necessary steps to find the first value of the tuple with the smallest second value. The code snippet in the context is also well-structured and follows the plan accurately. There are no missing steps, and the logic is sound.

Plan:
1) Define the function `index_minimum` that takes a list of tuples as an argument.
2) Initialize a variable `min_value` to infinity to track the smallest second value found.
3) Initialize a variable `min_first_value` to store the first value of the tuple with the smallest second value.
4) Iterate through each tuple in the list, unpacking the first and second values.
5) For each tuple, check if the second value is less than `min_value`. If it is, update `min_value` and set `min_first_value` to the first value of the current tuple.
6) After the loop, return `min_first_value`, which will contain the first value of the tuple with the smallest second value.

Code:
```python
def index_minimum(tuples_list):
    min_value = float('inf')  # Start with infinity
    min_first_value = None
