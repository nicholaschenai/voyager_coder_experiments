"""
Write a python function to find even numbers from a list of numbers.
assert Split([1,2,3,4,5]) == [2,4]
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/629 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding even numbers from a list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `Split` that takes a list of numbers as an argument.

2. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop (like a for loop) to go through each number in the provided list.

3. **Check for Even Numbers**: For each number, check if it is even. A number is considered even if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., `number % 2 == 0`).

4. **Collect Even Numbers**: If a number is even, add it to a new list that will store all the even numbers.

5. **Return the Result**: After iterating through the entire list, return the new list containing only the even numbers.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps in Python:

```python
def Split(numbers):
    even_numbers = []
    for number in numbers:
        if number % 2 == 0:
            even_numbers.append(number)
    return even_numbers

# Example usage
assert Split([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [2, 4]
```

In this implementation, the function `Split` successfully identifies and returns the even numbers from the input list. The `assert` statement is used to verify that the function works as expected.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding even numbers from a list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `Split` that takes a list of numbers as an argument.

2. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop (like a for loop) to go through each number in the provided list.

3. **Check for Even Numbers**: For each number, check if it is even. A number is considered even if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., `number % 2 == 0`).

4. **Collect Even Numbers**: If a number is even, add it to a new list that will store all the even numbers.

5. **Return the Result**: After iterating through the entire list, return the new list containing only the even numbers.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps in Python:

```python
def Split(numbers):
    even_numbers = []
    for number in numbers:
        if number % 2 == 0:
            even_numbers.append(number)
    return even_numbers

# Example usage
assert Split([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [2, 4]
```

In this implementation, the function `Split` successfully identifies and returns the even numbers from the input list. The `assert` statement is used to verify that the function works as expected.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/629 [generation text] Explain: The provided plan and code implementation are correct and complete. The function `Split` is defined to take a list of numbers, iterates through it, checks for even numbers, and collects them in a new list, which is then returned. The assertion provided will pass as the function correctly identifies the even numbers from the input list.

Plan:
1) Define the function `Split` that takes a list of integers as input.
2) Initialize an empty list to store even numbers.
3) Iterate through each number in the input list.
4) Check if the number is even using the modulus operator.
5) If the number is even, append it to the list of even numbers.
6) Return the list of even numbers.

Code:
```python
def Split(numbers):
    even_numbers = []
    for number in numbers:
        if number % 2 == 0:
            even_numbers.append(number)
