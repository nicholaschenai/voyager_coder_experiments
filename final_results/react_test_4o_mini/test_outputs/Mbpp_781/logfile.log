Write a python function to check whether the count of divisors is even. 
assert count_divisors(10)
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/781 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of checking whether the count of divisors of a number is even in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `count_divisors` that takes an integer as an argument.

2. **Initialize a Counter**: Inside the function, initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of divisors.

3. **Loop Through Possible Divisors**: Use a loop to iterate through all integers from 1 to the given number (inclusive). For each integer, check if it divides the given number without leaving a remainder.

4. **Count Divisors**: If a number divides the given number evenly (i.e., the remainder is zero), increment the counter.

5. **Check Evenness**: After counting all divisors, check if the count is even by using the modulus operator (`%`). If the count is even, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.

6. **Use Assertion**: Finally, you can use an assertion to test the function with a specific number, such as 10, to ensure it behaves as expected.

Here is a conceptual outline of the code:

```python
def count_divisors(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
    return count % 2 == 0  # Returns True if count is even

# Example usage
assert count_divisors(10)  # This will pass if the count of divisors of 10 is even
```

In this example, the function will return `True` for the number 10, as it has four divisors (1, 2, 5, 10), which is even.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of checking whether the count of divisors of a number is even in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `count_divisors` that takes an integer as an argument.

2. **Initialize a Counter**: Inside the function, initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of divisors.

3. **Loop Through Possible Divisors**: Use a loop to iterate through all integers from 1 to the given number (inclusive). For each integer, check if it divides the given number without leaving a remainder.

4. **Count Divisors**: If a number divides the given number evenly (i.e., the remainder is zero), increment the counter.

5. **Check Evenness**: After counting all divisors, check if the count is even by using the modulus operator (`%`). If the count is even, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.

6. **Use Assertion**: Finally, you can use an assertion to test the function with a specific number, such as 10, to ensure it behaves as expected.

Here is a conceptual outline of the code:

```python
def count_divisors(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
    return count % 2 == 0  # Returns True if count is even

# Example usage
assert count_divisors(10)  # This will pass if the count of divisors of 10 is even
```

In this example, the function will return `True` for the number 10, as it has four divisors (1, 2, 5, 10), which is even.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/781 [generation text] Explain: The provided plan is mostly correct and outlines the necessary steps to implement the function. The function `count_divisors` is defined to count the divisors of a number and check if that count is even. The logic for counting divisors and checking for evenness is sound. The assertion at the end is also appropriate for testing the function.

Plan:
1) Define the function `count_divisors` that takes an integer `n` as input.
2) Initialize a counter variable to zero to keep track of the number of divisors.
3) Use a loop to iterate through all integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
4) For each integer, check if it divides `n` evenly (i.e., `n % i == 0`).
5) If it does, increment the counter.
6) After the loop, check if the counter is even using the modulus operator (`%`).
7) Return `True` if the count is even, otherwise return `False`.

Code:
```python
def count_divisors(n: int) -> bool:
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
