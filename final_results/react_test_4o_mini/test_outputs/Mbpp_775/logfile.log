"""
Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
assert odd_position([2,1,4,3,6,7,6,3]) == True
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/775 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of checking whether every odd index in a given list contains odd numbers, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `odd_position` that takes a list as an argument.

2. **Iterate Over the List**: Use a loop to iterate through the indices of the list. You can use the `enumerate` function to get both the index and the value of each element.

3. **Check Odd Indices**: For each index, check if it is odd (i.e., `index % 2 != 0`).

4. **Check for Odd Numbers**: If the index is odd, check if the corresponding value at that index is an odd number (i.e., `value % 2 != 0`).

5. **Return Result**: If you find any odd index that does not contain an odd number, return `False`. If all odd indices contain odd numbers, return `True`.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def odd_position(lst):
    for index, value in enumerate(lst):
        if index % 2 != 0:  # Check if the index is odd
            if value % 2 == 0:  # Check if the value is not odd
                return False
    return True
```

6. **Testing the Function**: You can use the provided assertion to test the function, ensuring it behaves as expected.

By following these steps, you can effectively implement the function to check the condition specified in the task.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Task]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.

"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of checking whether every odd index in a given list contains odd numbers, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `odd_position` that takes a list as an argument.

2. **Iterate Over the List**: Use a loop to iterate through the indices of the list. You can use the `enumerate` function to get both the index and the value of each element.

3. **Check Odd Indices**: For each index, check if it is odd (i.e., `index % 2 != 0`).

4. **Check for Odd Numbers**: If the index is odd, check if the corresponding value at that index is an odd number (i.e., `value % 2 != 0`).

5. **Return Result**: If you find any odd index that does not contain an odd number, return `False`. If all odd indices contain odd numbers, return `True`.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def odd_position(lst):
    for index, value in enumerate(lst):
        if index % 2 != 0:  # Check if the index is odd
            if value % 2 == 0:  # Check if the value is not odd
                return False
    return True
```

6. **Testing the Function**: You can use the provided assertion to test the function, ensuring it behaves as expected.

By following these steps, you can effectively implement the function to check the condition specified in the task.
