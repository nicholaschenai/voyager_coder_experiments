Write a function to extract values between quotation marks from a string.
assert extract_values('"Python", "PHP", "Java"')==['Python', 'PHP', 'Java']
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/563 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of extracting values between quotation marks from a string in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function named `extract_values` that takes a string as an argument.

2. **Use Regular Expressions**: Utilize the `re` module, which provides support for regular expressions in Python. This will allow you to search for patterns in the string.

3. **Create a Pattern**: Construct a regular expression pattern that matches text enclosed in double quotation marks. The pattern `r'"(.*?)"'` can be used, where:
   - `"` matches the opening quotation mark.
   - `(.*?)` is a capturing group that matches any character (`.`) zero or more times (`*`), but as few times as possible (`?`), effectively capturing the text inside the quotes.
   - The final `"` matches the closing quotation mark.

4. **Find All Matches**: Use the `re.findall()` function to find all occurrences of the pattern in the input string. This function returns a list of all matches.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the list of extracted values.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
import re

def extract_values(s):
    # Use regular expression to find all values between quotes
    return re.findall(r'"(.*?)"', s)
```

With this function, calling `extract_values('"Python", "PHP", "Java"')` will return `['Python', 'PHP', 'Java']`, as expected.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of extracting values between quotation marks from a string in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function named `extract_values` that takes a string as an argument.

2. **Use Regular Expressions**: Utilize the `re` module, which provides support for regular expressions in Python. This will allow you to search for patterns in the string.

3. **Create a Pattern**: Construct a regular expression pattern that matches text enclosed in double quotation marks. The pattern `r'"(.*?)"'` can be used, where:
   - `"` matches the opening quotation mark.
   - `(.*?)` is a capturing group that matches any character (`.`) zero or more times (`*`), but as few times as possible (`?`), effectively capturing the text inside the quotes.
   - The final `"` matches the closing quotation mark.

4. **Find All Matches**: Use the `re.findall()` function to find all occurrences of the pattern in the input string. This function returns a list of all matches.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the list of extracted values.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
import re

def extract_values(s):
    # Use regular expression to find all values between quotes
    return re.findall(r'"(.*?)"', s)
```

With this function, calling `extract_values('"Python", "PHP", "Java"')` will return `['Python', 'PHP', 'Java']`, as expected.
