"""
Write a function that checks if a strings contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.
assert text_match_wordz_middle("pythonzabc.")==True
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/643 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of checking if a string contains the letter 'z' except at the start and end of the word, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `text_match_wordz_middle` that takes a single string argument.

2. **Check String Length**: First, check if the string is long enough to have characters in the middle (i.e., it should have at least 3 characters). If the string is shorter than 3 characters, return `False` immediately.

3. **Extract Middle Section**: Use string slicing to extract the substring that excludes the first and last characters. This can be done using `string[1:-1]`.

4. **Check for 'z'**: Use the `in` operator to check if 'z' is present in the middle substring.

5. **Return the Result**: Return `True` if 'z' is found in the middle substring, otherwise return `False`.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def text_match_wordz_middle(s):
    # Step 1: Check if the string is long enough
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    
    # Step 2: Extract the middle part of the string
    middle_part = s[1:-1]
    
    # Step 3: Check for 'z' in the middle part
    return 'z' in middle_part
```

This function will correctly assert that `text_match_wordz_middle("pythonzabc.")` returns `True` because 'z' is present in the middle of the string.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of checking if a string contains the letter 'z' except at the start and end of the word, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `text_match_wordz_middle` that takes a single string argument.

2. **Check String Length**: First, check if the string is long enough to have characters in the middle (i.e., it should have at least 3 characters). If the string is shorter than 3 characters, return `False` immediately.

3. **Extract Middle Section**: Use string slicing to extract the substring that excludes the first and last characters. This can be done using `string[1:-1]`.

4. **Check for 'z'**: Use the `in` operator to check if 'z' is present in the middle substring.

5. **Return the Result**: Return `True` if 'z' is found in the middle substring, otherwise return `False`.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def text_match_wordz_middle(s):
    # Step 1: Check if the string is long enough
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    
    # Step 2: Extract the middle part of the string
    middle_part = s[1:-1]
    
    # Step 3: Check for 'z' in the middle part
    return 'z' in middle_part
```

This function will correctly assert that `text_match_wordz_middle("pythonzabc.")` returns `True` because 'z' is present in the middle of the string.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/643 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct and outlines the necessary steps to implement the function. It correctly identifies the need to check the length of the string, extract the middle section, and check for the presence of 'z'. The function name and the expected behavior align with the task requirements.

Plan:
1) Define the function `text_match_wordz_middle` that takes a single string argument.
2) Check if the string length is less than 3; if so, return `False`.
3) Extract the middle section of the string using slicing (`s[1:-1]`).
4) Check if 'z' is present in the middle section using the `in` operator.
5) Return `True` if 'z' is found, otherwise return `False`.

Code:
```python
def text_match_wordz_middle(s: str) -> bool:
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    middle_part = s[1:-1]
    return 'z' in middle_part
