INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/445 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of performing index-wise multiplication of elements in two tuples in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function named `index_multiplication` that takes two tuples as arguments.

2. **Iterate Over the Tuples**: Use a loop to iterate over the elements of the tuples. Since the tuples contain pairs of numbers, you can use the `zip` function to pair corresponding elements from both tuples together.

3. **Multiply the Elements**: For each pair of elements obtained from the `zip`, multiply the corresponding elements together.

4. **Store the Results**: Collect the results of the multiplications into a new tuple.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the new tuple containing the results of the index-wise multiplications.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def index_multiplication(tuple1, tuple2):
    # Use zip to pair elements from both tuples and multiply them
    result = tuple((a * b for a, b in zip(pair1, pair2)) for pair1, pair2 in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
    return result
```

In this outline:
- `zip(tuple1, tuple2)` pairs the corresponding tuples together.
- The inner `zip(pair1, pair2)` pairs the elements of each tuple for multiplication.
- The result is collected into a new tuple using a generator expression.

This approach ensures that the multiplication is done index-wise, and the final result matches the expected output as specified in the assertion.

At each round of conversation, I will give you

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of performing index-wise multiplication of elements in two tuples in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function named `index_multiplication` that takes two tuples as arguments.

2. **Iterate Over the Tuples**: Use a loop to iterate over the elements of the tuples. Since the tuples contain pairs of numbers, you can use the `zip` function to pair corresponding elements from both tuples together.

3. **Multiply the Elements**: For each pair of elements obtained from the `zip`, multiply the corresponding elements together.

4. **Store the Results**: Collect the results of the multiplications into a new tuple.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the new tuple containing the results of the index-wise multiplications.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def index_multiplication(tuple1, tuple2):
    # Use zip to pair elements from both tuples and multiply them
    result = tuple((a * b for a, b in zip(pair1, pair2)) for pair1, pair2 in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
    return result
```

In this outline:
- `zip(tuple1, tuple2)` pairs the corresponding tuples together.
- The inner `zip(pair1, pair2)` pairs the elements of each tuple for multiplication.
- The result is collected into a new tuple using a generator expression.

This approach ensures that the multiplication is done index-wise, and the final result matches the expected output as specified in the assertion.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/445 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct, but the implementation in the outline has a small issue with the tuple comprehension. The inner generator expression should be wrapped in a tuple constructor to ensure that the result is a tuple. 

Plan:
1) Define the function `index_multiplication` that takes two tuples as arguments.
2) Use the `zip` function to pair corresponding elements from both tuples.
3) For each pair of tuples, use another `zip` to pair the elements and multiply them.
4) Collect the results of the multiplications into a new tuple.
5) Return the new tuple containing the results.

Code:
```python
def index_multiplication(tuple1, tuple2):

    return result
