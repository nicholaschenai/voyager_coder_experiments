"""
Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
assert largest_subset([ 1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18 ]) == 4
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/620 [generation text] Answer: To solve the problem of finding the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair in the subset is divisible, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understanding Divisibility**: For a pair of numbers (a, b) to be divisible, either a % b == 0 or b % a == 0 must hold true. This means that one number must be a multiple of the other.

2. **Sorting the List**: Start by sorting the list of numbers. This helps in efficiently checking divisibility since if a number is divisible by another, it will appear later in the sorted list.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: Use a dynamic programming (DP) approach to keep track of the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with each number in the sorted list. Create a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with the number at index `i`.

4. **Filling the DP Array**:
   - Initialize each entry in the DP array to 1, as each number can at least form a subset of size 1 (itself).
   - For each number at index `i`, check all previous numbers at index `j` (where j < i). If the number at index `i` is divisible by the number at index `j`, update `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.

5. **Finding the Result**: The size of the largest subset will be the maximum value in the DP array after processing all numbers.

6. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the maximum value found in the DP array as the size of the largest divisible subset.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def largest_subset(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    
    nums.sort()
    n = len(nums)
    dp = [1] * n  # Each number can form a subset of size 1
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:  # Check divisibility
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    
    return max(dp)  # The largest size of the subset
```

This function will correctly compute the size of the largest subset where every pair is divisible.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

    nums.sort()
    n = len(nums)
    dp = [1] * n  # Each number can form a subset of size 1
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:  # Check divisibility
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    
    return max(dp)  # The largest size of the subset

This function will correctly compute the size of the largest subset where every pair is divisible.

The code snippet at the end of the plan is also correctly structured to implement the outlined logic. There are no missing steps, and the approach is appropriate for the task.

Plan:
1) Define the function `largest_subset` that takes a list of integers as input.
2) Check if the input list is empty; if so, return 0.
3) Sort the input list to facilitate the divisibility checks.
4) Initialize a dynamic programming (DP) array where each entry starts at 1, representing the minimum size of the subset that can be formed with each number.
5) Use nested loops to fill the DP array:
   - For each number at index `i`, iterate through all previous numbers at index `j`.
   - If the number at index `i` is divisible by the number at index `j`, update the DP value at `i` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.
