"""
Write a python function to find the element that appears only once in a sorted array.
assert search([1,1,2,2,3]) == 3
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/119 [generation text] Answer: To find the element that appears only once in a sorted array, you can utilize a binary search approach, which is efficient given that the array is sorted. The key idea is to leverage the properties of the sorted array to narrow down the search space.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of how to accomplish this:

1. **Initialize Pointers**: Start with two pointers, `left` at the beginning of the array and `right` at the end.

2. **Binary Search Loop**: While `left` is less than `right`, calculate the middle index `mid`. 

3. **Check Parity**: Determine if the `mid` index is even or odd:
   - If `mid` is even, check if the element at `mid` is equal to the element at `mid + 1`. If they are equal, it means the single element is in the right half of the array (since pairs are formed on the left). Thus, move the `left` pointer to `mid + 2`. If they are not equal, move the `right` pointer to `mid`.
   - If `mid` is odd, check if the element at `mid` is equal to the element at `mid - 1`. If they are equal, it means the single element is in the right half, so move `left` to `mid + 1`. If they are not equal, move `right` to `mid`.

4. **Termination**: When the loop ends, `left` will point to the single element.

5. **Return the Result**: Return the element at the `left` pointer.

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of the above logic:

```python
def search(arr):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        
        if mid % 2 == 0:
            if arr[mid] == arr[mid + 1]:
                left = mid + 2
            else:
                right = mid
        else:
            if arr[mid] == arr[mid - 1]:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid
    
    return arr[left]

# Example usage
assert search([1, 1, 2, 2, 3]) == 3
```

This function efficiently finds the element that appears only once in a sorted array using a binary search approach, achieving a time complexity of O(log n).

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/119 [generation text] Explain: The provided plan and code implementation are correct and follow the binary search approach to find the element that appears only once in a sorted array. The logic for checking the parity of the `mid` index and adjusting the `left` and `right` pointers is sound. The code is structured to return the correct result as specified in the task.

Plan:
1) Initialize two pointers, `left` at the start of the array and `right` at the end.
2) Use a while loop to perform binary search until `left` is less than `right`.
3) Calculate the middle index `mid` and check its parity (even or odd).
4) Depending on the parity, compare the element at `mid` with its neighbors to decide which half of the array to search next.
5) When the loop ends, return the element at the `left` pointer, which will be the single element.

def search(arr):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
