INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/86 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to find nth centered hexagonal number.
assert centered_hexagonal_number(10) == 271
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/86 [generation text] Answer: To find the nth centered hexagonal number in Python, you can use the formula for centered hexagonal numbers, which is given by:

\[ H(n) = 3n(n - 1) + 1 \]

This formula derives from the geometric arrangement of hexagonal numbers, where each centered hexagonal number can be visualized as a hexagon with a central point and layers of hexagons surrounding it.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of how to implement this in a function:

1. **Define the function**: Create a function named `centered_hexagonal_number` that takes an integer `n` as an argument.

2. **Apply the formula**: Inside the function, use the formula to calculate the nth centered hexagonal number.

3. **Return the result**: Finally, return the computed value.

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of the above steps in Python:

```python
def centered_hexagonal_number(n):
    return 3 * n * (n - 1) + 1

# Example usage
assert centered_hexagonal_number(10) == 271
```

In this code:
- The function `centered_hexagonal_number` computes the nth centered hexagonal number using the formula.
- The `assert` statement checks that the function returns the expected value for `n = 10`, which is 271.

This approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging the mathematical properties of centered hexagonal numbers.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

Answer: To find the nth centered hexagonal number in Python, you can use the formula for centered hexagonal numbers, which is given by:
