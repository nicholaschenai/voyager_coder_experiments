"""
Write a function that takes in two tuples and performs mathematical division operation element-wise across the given tuples.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/261 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of performing element-wise division on two tuples in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `division_elements` that takes two tuples as parameters.

2. **Check Tuple Lengths**: Ensure that both tuples have the same length. If they don't, you might want to raise an error or handle it appropriately.

3. **Iterate Over Elements**: Use a loop (like a `for` loop) to iterate over the indices of the tuples. For each index, retrieve the corresponding elements from both tuples.

4. **Perform Division**: For each pair of elements, perform the division operation. You can use integer division (`//`) if you want the result to be an integer, or regular division (`/`) if you want a float.

5. **Store Results**: Collect the results of the division in a new tuple. You can use a list to gather the results and then convert it back to a tuple at the end.

6. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the new tuple containing the results of the element-wise division.

Here is a conceptual example of how the function might look:

```python
def division_elements(tuple1, tuple2):
    if len(tuple1) != len(tuple2):
        raise ValueError("Tuples must be of the same length")
    
    result = []
    for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2):
        result.append(a // b)  # Use // for integer division
    return tuple(result)
```

In this example, `zip` is used to pair elements from both tuples, and the division is performed for each pair. The result is collected in a list and converted to a tuple before returning.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/261 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct and outlines the necessary steps to perform element-wise division on two tuples. However, it does not explicitly mention handling division by zero, which is an important consideration when performing division operations. Additionally, the plan suggests using integer division (`//`), but the assertion indicates that regular division should be used to produce float results.

Plan:
1) Define a function named `division_elements` that takes two tuples as parameters.
2) Check if both tuples have the same length; if not, raise a ValueError.
3) Initialize an empty list to store the results of the division.
4) Use a loop to iterate over the elements of both tuples simultaneously.
5) For each pair of elements, perform division and handle any potential division by zero by returning `None` or raising an exception.
6) Convert the list of results to a tuple and return it.

Code:
```python
def division_elements(tuple1, tuple2):
    if len(tuple1) != len(tuple2):
        raise ValueError("Tuples must be of the same length")
