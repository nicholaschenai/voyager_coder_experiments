INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/622 [generation text] Answer: To find the median of two sorted lists of the same size in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Combine the Lists**: Since both lists are sorted, you can merge them into a single sorted list. This can be done using a two-pointer technique where you compare the elements of both lists and append the smaller one to a new list until all elements are processed.

2. **Calculate the Median**: Once you have the combined sorted list, the median can be found by:
   - If the total number of elements (which is the sum of the lengths of both lists) is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.
   - If the total number of elements is odd, the median is the middle element.

3. **Implement the Function**: You can implement this logic in a function that takes two sorted lists and their size as arguments, merges them, and then calculates and returns the median.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def get_median(list1, list2, size):
    # Step 1: Merge the two sorted lists
    merged_list = []
    i, j = 0, 0
    
    while i < size and j < size:
        if list1[i] < list2[j]:
            merged_list.append(list1[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            merged_list.append(list2[j])
            j += 1
            
    # If there are remaining elements in list1
    while i < size:
        merged_list.append(list1[i])
        i += 1
        
    # If there are remaining elements in list2
    while j < size:
        merged_list.append(list2[j])
        j += 1
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the median
    mid = size
    median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2.0
    
    return median
```

This function will correctly compute the median of the two sorted lists as specified in the assertion.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/622 [generation text] Explain: The provided conceptual outline is mostly correct, but there is a small mistake in the calculation of the median. Since the total number of elements in the merged list is even (2 * size), the median should be calculated using the two middle elements, which are at indices `size - 1` and `size`. The current implementation incorrectly uses `mid` which is set to `size`, leading to an index error. 

Plan:
1) Merge the two sorted lists into a single sorted list using a two-pointer technique.
2) Calculate the median by averaging the two middle elements of the merged list.
3) Return the calculated median.
