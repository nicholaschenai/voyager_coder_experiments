INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/748 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to put spaces between words starting with capital letters in a given string.
assert capital_words_spaces("Python") == 'Python'
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/748 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of inserting spaces between words that start with capital letters in a given string, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Iterate through the String**: Loop through each character in the string to examine its properties.

2. **Check for Capital Letters**: For each character, check if it is an uppercase letter. In Python, you can use the `isupper()` method to determine if a character is uppercase.

3. **Build the Result**: As you iterate, you can build a new string (or list) that includes spaces before each uppercase letter, except for the first character of the string.

4. **Join the Result**: Finally, join the characters or words together to form the final string with spaces.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic:

```python
def capital_words_spaces(s):
    if not s:  # Handle empty string case
        return s
    result = [s[0]]  # Start with the first character
    for char in s[1:]:  # Iterate from the second character
        if char.isupper():  # Check if the character is uppercase
            result.append(' ')  # Add a space before the uppercase letter
        result.append(char)  # Add the character itself
    return ''.join(result)  # Join the list into a single string
```

This function will correctly insert spaces before each capital letter in the string, while preserving the original case and order of the characters. The assertion provided in the question confirms that if the input is a single capitalized word, it should return the word unchanged.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

[Task]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to put spaces between words starting with capital letters in a given string.
assert capital_words_spaces("Python") == 'Python'
"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of inserting spaces between words that start with capital letters in a given string, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Iterate through the String**: Loop through each character in the string to examine its properties.

2. **Check for Capital Letters**: For each character, check if it is an uppercase letter. In Python, you can use the `isupper()` method to determine if a character is uppercase.

3. **Build the Result**: As you iterate, you can build a new string (or list) that includes spaces before each uppercase letter, except for the first character of the string.

4. **Join the Result**: Finally, join the characters or words together to form the final string with spaces.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic:

```python
def capital_words_spaces(s):
    if not s:  # Handle empty string case
        return s
    result = [s[0]]  # Start with the first character
    for char in s[1:]:  # Iterate from the second character
        if char.isupper():  # Check if the character is uppercase
            result.append(' ')  # Add a space before the uppercase letter
        result.append(char)  # Add the character itself
    return ''.join(result)  # Join the list into a single string
```

This function will correctly insert spaces before each capital letter in the string, while preserving the original case and order of the characters. The assertion provided in the question confirms that if the input is a single capitalized word, it should return the word unchanged.


[Critique]
None


INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/748 [generation text] Explain: The provided plan and implementation correctly outline the steps to insert spaces before capital letters in a string. The function handles the case of an empty string and ensures that the first character is not preceded by a space. The assertion provided in the task confirms that the function should return the input unchanged if it consists of a single capitalized word, which the implementation satisfies.

Plan:
1) Define the function `capital_words_spaces` that takes a string as input.
2) Check if the input string is empty; if so, return it immediately.
3) Initialize a list to hold the result, starting with the first character of the string.
4) Iterate through the string starting from the second character.
5) For each character, check if it is uppercase:
   - If it is, append a space to the result list before appending the character.
6) Join the list into a single string and return it.

Code:
```python
def capital_words_spaces(s: str) -> str:
    if not s:  # Handle empty string case
        return s
    result = [s[0]]  # Start with the first character
    for char in s[1:]:  # Iterate from the second character
        if char.isupper():  # Check if the character is uppercase
            result.append(' ')  # Add a space before the uppercase letter
        result.append(char)  # Add the character itself
    return ''.join(result)  # Join the list into a single string
