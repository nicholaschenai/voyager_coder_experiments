INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/297 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of flattening a nested list structure in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function named `flatten_list` that takes a single argument, which is the nested list.

2. **Initialize an Empty List**: Inside the function, create an empty list that will hold the flattened elements.

3. **Iterate Through the Input List**: Use a loop to iterate through each element of the input list. For each element, check its type.

4. **Check for Nested Lists**: If the current element is a list (you can use the `isinstance()` function to check), recursively call the `flatten_list` function on that element. This will allow you to flatten any nested lists.

5. **Append Elements**: If the current element is not a list (i.e., it's a base case like an integer), append it directly to the flattened list.

6. **Return the Result**: After processing all elements, return the flattened list.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def flatten_list(nested_list):
    flattened = []  # Step 2: Initialize an empty list
    for element in nested_list:  # Step 3: Iterate through the input list
        if isinstance(element, list):  # Step 4: Check for nested lists
            flattened.extend(flatten_list(element))  # Recursive call
        else:
            flattened.append(element)  # Step 5: Append non-list elements
    return flattened  # Step 6: Return the flattened list
```

This approach effectively handles any level of nesting in the list structure, ensuring that all elements are collected into a single flat list.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

The code snippet in the plan is also correctly structured to achieve the desired functionality. There are no missing steps, and the logic is sound for handling nested lists.

Plan:

2) Initialize an empty list called `flattened` to store the flattened elements.
3) Iterate through each element in `nested_list`.
4) For each element, check if it is a list using `isinstance()`.
5) If it is a list, recursively call `flatten_list` on that element and extend the `flattened` list with the result.
6) If it is not a list, append the element directly to the `flattened` list.
7) Return the `flattened` list after processing all elements.
