"""
Write a function to that rotate left bits by d bits a given number. We assume that the number is 32 bit.
assert left_rotate(16,2) == 64
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/799 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of rotating the bits of a given number to the left by a specified number of positions in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand Bit Rotation**: Rotating bits to the left means that the bits that overflow from the leftmost position will wrap around to the rightmost position. For example, if you have a binary number and you rotate it left by 1, the leftmost bit moves to the rightmost position.

2. **Use Bitwise Operations**: You can use bitwise operations to achieve the rotation. Specifically, you can use the left shift (`<<`) and right shift (`>>`) operators.

3. **Masking**: Since we are dealing with a 32-bit number, you need to ensure that the result remains within 32 bits. This can be done using a bitwise AND operation with a mask (in this case, `0xFFFFFFFF`).

4. **Function Implementation**:
   - Shift the number to the left by `d` bits.
   - Shift the number to the right by `(32 - d)` bits to get the bits that overflow.
   - Combine both results using the bitwise OR operator.

5. **Handle the Input**: Ensure that the number of bits to rotate (`d`) is within the range of 0 to 31, as rotating by 32 or more would result in the same number.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def left_rotate(n, d):
    # Ensure d is within the range of 0 to 31
    d = d % 32
    # Perform the left rotation
    return ((n << d) | (n >> (32 - d))) & 0xFFFFFFFF
```

In this function:
- `n << d` shifts the bits of `n` to the left by `d` positions.
- `n >> (32 - d)` shifts the bits of `n` to the right by `(32 - d)` positions to capture the overflow bits.
- The bitwise OR combines both results, and the final AND operation with `0xFFFFFFFF` ensures that the result is treated as a 32-bit number.

With this approach, calling `left_rotate(16, 2)` will yield `64`, as expected.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of rotating the bits of a given number to the left by a specified number of positions in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand Bit Rotation**: Rotating bits to the left means that the bits that overflow from the leftmost position will wrap around to the rightmost position. For example, if you have a binary number and you rotate it left by 1, the leftmost bit moves to the rightmost position.

   - Shift the number to the right by `(32 - d)` bits to get the bits that overflow.
   - Combine both results using the bitwise OR operator.

5. **Handle the Input**: Ensure that the number of bits to rotate (`d`) is within the range of 0 to 31, as rotating by 32 or more would result in the same number.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

    # Perform the left rotation
    return ((n << d) | (n >> (32 - d))) & 0xFFFFFFFF
```

In this function:
- `n << d` shifts the bits of `n` to the left by `d` positions.
- `n >> (32 - d)` shifts the bits of `n` to the right by `(32 - d)` positions to capture the overflow bits.
- The bitwise OR combines both results, and the final AND operation with `0xFFFFFFFF` ensures that the result is treated as a 32-bit number.

1) Define the function `left_rotate` that takes two parameters: an integer `n` and an integer `d`.
2) Use the modulo operator to ensure `d` is within the range of 0 to 31.
3) Perform the left rotation using bitwise operations:
   - Shift `n` left by `d` bits.
