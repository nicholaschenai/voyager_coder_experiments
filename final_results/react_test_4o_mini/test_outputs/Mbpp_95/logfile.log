"""
Write a python function to find the length of the smallest list in a list of lists.
assert Find_Min_Length([[1],[1,2]]) == 1
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/95 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the length of the smallest list in a list of lists in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `Find_Min_Length` that takes a single argument, which is a list of lists.

2. **Initialize a Variable**: Inside the function, you can initialize a variable to hold the minimum length found. You can start with a value that is larger than any possible list length, such as `float('inf')`.

3. **Iterate Through the Lists**: Use a loop to iterate through each sublist in the main list. For each sublist, calculate its length using the `len()` function.

4. **Update Minimum Length**: During each iteration, compare the length of the current sublist with the minimum length variable. If the current length is smaller, update the minimum length variable.

5. **Return the Result**: After checking all sublists, return the minimum length found.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def Find_Min_Length(list_of_lists):
    min_length = float('inf')  # Start with a very large number
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        current_length = len(sublist)  # Get the length of the current sublist
        if current_length < min_length:  # Check if it's smaller than the current minimum
            min_length = current_length  # Update the minimum length
    return min_length  # Return the smallest length found
```

This function will correctly find the length of the smallest list in the provided list of lists. The assertion provided in the question can be used to test the function.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the length of the smallest list in a list of lists in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `Find_Min_Length` that takes a single argument, which is a list of lists.

2. **Initialize a Variable**: Inside the function, you can initialize a variable to hold the minimum length found. You can start with a value that is larger than any possible list length, such as `float('inf')`.

3. **Iterate Through the Lists**: Use a loop to iterate through each sublist in the main list. For each sublist, calculate its length using the `len()` function.

4. **Update Minimum Length**: During each iteration, compare the length of the current sublist with the minimum length variable. If the current length is smaller, update the minimum length variable.

5. **Return the Result**: After checking all sublists, return the minimum length found.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def Find_Min_Length(list_of_lists):
    min_length = float('inf')  # Start with a very large number
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        current_length = len(sublist)  # Get the length of the current sublist
        if current_length < min_length:  # Check if it's smaller than the current minimum
            min_length = current_length  # Update the minimum length
    return min_length  # Return the smallest length found
```

This function will correctly find the length of the smallest list in the provided list of lists. The assertion provided in the question can be used to test the function.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/95 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided in the context is correct and outlines the necessary steps to find the length of the smallest list in a list of lists. The function should iterate through each sublist, calculate its length, and keep track of the minimum length found. The assertion provided will test the function to ensure it works as intended.

Plan:
1) Define the function `Find_Min_Length` that takes a parameter `list_of_lists`.
2) Initialize a variable `min_length` to `float('inf')` to represent the smallest length found.
3) Iterate through each sublist in `list_of_lists`.
4) For each sublist, calculate its length and compare it with `min_length`.
5) If the current sublist's length is smaller than `min_length`, update `min_length`.
6) After the loop, return `min_length`.

Code:
```python
def Find_Min_Length(list_of_lists):
    min_length = float('inf')  # Start with a very large number
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        current_length = len(sublist)  # Get the length of the current sublist
        if current_length < min_length:  # Check if it's smaller than the current minimum
