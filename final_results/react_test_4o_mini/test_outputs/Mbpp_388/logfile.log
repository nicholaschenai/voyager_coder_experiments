"""
Write a python function to find the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to n.
assert highest_Power_of_2(10) == 8
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/388 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to a given number `n`, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understanding Powers of 2**: Powers of 2 are numbers like 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. Each of these can be represented as \(2^k\) where \(k\) is a non-negative integer.

2. **Iterative Approach**: You can start from the smallest power of 2 (which is 1) and keep multiplying by 2 until the result exceeds `n`. The last valid power of 2 before exceeding `n` will be your answer.

3. **Using Bit Manipulation**: Alternatively, you can use bit manipulation. The highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n` can be found by using the properties of binary representation. Specifically, you can use the bit length of `n` to determine the highest power of 2.

4. **Implementation**: You can implement this logic in a function. Hereâ€™s a simple way to do it using a loop:

```python
def highest_Power_of_2(n):
    power = 1
    while power <= n:
        power *= 2
    return power // 2  # Return the last valid power of 2
```

5. **Testing the Function**: You can test the function using the provided assertion to ensure it works correctly.

By following these steps, you can create a function that effectively finds the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/388 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct and outlines a valid approach to find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. The iterative approach is straightforward and will work as intended. However, the implementation provided in the plan has a small issue: it should return the last valid power of 2 before exceeding `n`, which is correctly handled by dividing by 2 after the loop. 

Plan:
1) Initialize a variable `power` to 1, which represents the current power of 2.
2) Use a while loop to multiply `power` by 2 until it exceeds `n`.
3) Once the loop exits, return `power // 2` to get the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`.

Code:
```python
def highest_Power_of_2(n: int) -> int:
    power = 1
    while power <= n:
        power *= 2
    return power // 2
