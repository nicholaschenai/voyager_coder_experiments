"""
Write a python function to count the number of pairs whose xor value is odd.
assert find_Odd_Pair([5,4,7,2,1],5) == 6
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/556 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of counting the number of pairs whose XOR value is odd, we need to understand a few key concepts about XOR and the properties of odd and even numbers.

1. **XOR Operation**: The XOR (exclusive OR) operation between two bits results in `1` if the bits are different and `0` if they are the same. For two integers, the XOR operation is performed bit by bit.

2. **Odd and Even Numbers**: An integer is odd if it is not divisible by 2 (i.e., it has a remainder of 1 when divided by 2). The XOR of two integers is odd if one of them is odd and the other is even. This is because:
   - Odd XOR Odd = Even
   - Even XOR Even = Even
   - Odd XOR Even = Odd

3. **Counting Pairs**: To count the pairs whose XOR is odd, we can follow these steps:
   - Iterate through the list of numbers and count how many are odd and how many are even.
   - The number of valid pairs (one odd and one even) can be calculated by multiplying the count of odd numbers by the count of even numbers.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def find_Odd_Pair(arr, n):
    odd_count = 0
    even_count = 0
    
    # Count odd and even numbers
    for number in arr:
        if number % 2 == 0:
            even_count += 1
        else:
            odd_count += 1
            
    # The number of pairs with odd XOR is the product of odd and even counts
    return odd_count * even_count
```

In this function:
- We initialize two counters, `odd_count` and `even_count`.
- We loop through each number in the input list `arr` and update the counters based on whether the number is odd or even.
- Finally, we return the product of `odd_count` and `even_count`, which gives the total number of pairs whose XOR is odd.

This approach is efficient and straightforward, ensuring that we correctly count the pairs as required.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
