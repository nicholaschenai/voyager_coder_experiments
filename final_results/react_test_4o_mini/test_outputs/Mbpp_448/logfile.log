INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/448 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to calculate the sum of perrin numbers.
assert cal_sum(9) == 49
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/448 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of calculating the sum of Perrin numbers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand Perrin Numbers**: The Perrin sequence is defined as follows:
   - P(0) = 3
   - P(1) = 0
   - P(2) = 2
   - For n > 2, P(n) = P(n-2) + P(n-3)

2. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `cal_sum` that takes an integer `n` as an argument. This function will calculate the sum of the first `n` Perrin numbers.

3. **Calculate Perrin Numbers**: You can use a loop or recursion to generate the Perrin numbers up to the nth term. Store these numbers in a list or calculate them on-the-fly.

4. **Sum the Numbers**: Once you have the Perrin numbers, sum them up using Python's built-in `sum()` function.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the calculated sum.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def cal_sum(n):
    # Initialize the first three Perrin numbers
    if n < 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 0:
        return 3
    elif n == 1:
        return 3  # P(0)
    elif n == 2:
        return 3 + 0 + 2  # P(0) + P(1) + P(2)

    # List to store Perrin numbers
    perrin_numbers = [3, 0, 2]
    
    # Calculate Perrin numbers up to n
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        next_perrin = perrin_numbers[i - 2] + perrin_numbers[i - 3]
        perrin_numbers.append(next_perrin)

    # Calculate the sum of the first n Perrin numbers
    return sum(perrin_numbers[:n + 1])

# Example usage
assert cal_sum(9) == 49
```

This function will correctly calculate the sum of the first `n` Perrin numbers, and the assertion will pass for the given example.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/448 [generation text] Explain: The provided plan is mostly correct, but it lacks clarity in handling the case when `n` is less than 0. The function should return 0 in such cases, which is not explicitly stated in the plan. Additionally, the function should be structured to ensure that it only calculates the necessary Perrin numbers without unnecessary computations.

Plan:
1) Define the function `cal_sum` that takes an integer `n` as input.
2) Handle the base cases for `n` less than 0, 0, 1, and 2 directly.
3) For `n` greater than 2, initialize a list to store the first three Perrin numbers.
4) Use a loop to calculate and append the Perrin numbers up to `n`.
5) Return the sum of the calculated Perrin numbers.

Code:
```python
def cal_sum(n: int) -> int:
    if n < 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 0:
