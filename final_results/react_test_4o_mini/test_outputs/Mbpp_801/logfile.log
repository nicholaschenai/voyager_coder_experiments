INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/801 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a python function to count the number of equal numbers from three given integers.
assert test_three_equal(1,1,1) == 3
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/801 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of counting the number of equal integers among three given integers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `test_three_equal` that takes three integer parameters.

2. **Initialize a Counter**: Start with a counter set to zero. This counter will keep track of how many of the integers are equal.

3. **Compare the Integers**: Use conditional statements to compare the integers:
   - If all three integers are equal, increment the counter by 3.
   - If two of the integers are equal, increment the counter by 2.
   - If none are equal, the counter remains zero.

4. **Return the Counter**: Finally, return the counter value.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic:

```python
def test_three_equal(a, b, c):
    count = 0
    if a == b == c:
        count = 3
    elif a == b or b == c or a == c:
        count = 2
    return count
```

This function will correctly count the number of equal integers based on the conditions outlined. You can then use the `assert` statement to test the function as shown in your example.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

Answer: To accomplish the task of counting the number of equal integers among three given integers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `test_three_equal` that takes three integer parameters.

2. **Initialize a Counter**: Start with a counter set to zero. This counter will keep track of how many of the integers are equal.

3. **Compare the Integers**: Use conditional statements to compare the integers:
   - If all three integers are equal, increment the counter by 3.

   - If none are equal, the counter remains zero.

4. **Return the Counter**: Finally, return the counter value.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/801 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct and outlines the necessary steps to implement the function. The code snippet given in the context is also appropriate for the task. It correctly checks for equality among the three integers and counts how many are equal. 

Plan:
1) Define the function `test_three_equal` that takes three integer parameters.
2) Initialize a counter variable to zero.
3) Use conditional statements to check:
   - If all three integers are equal, set the counter to 3.
   - If any two integers are equal, set the counter to 2.
   - If none are equal, the counter remains zero.
4) Return the counter value.
