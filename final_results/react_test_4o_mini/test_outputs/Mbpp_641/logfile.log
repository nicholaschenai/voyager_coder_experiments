INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/641 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to find the nth nonagonal number.
assert is_nonagonal(10) == 325
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/641 [generation text] Answer: To find the nth nonagonal number in Python, you first need to understand the formula for nonagonal numbers. The nth nonagonal number can be calculated using the formula:

\[ P(n) = \frac{n(7n - 5)}{2} \]

where \( P(n) \) is the nth nonagonal number.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of how to accomplish this task:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `nonagonal_number` that takes an integer \( n \) as an argument.

2. **Implement the Formula**: Inside the function, use the formula mentioned above to calculate the nth nonagonal number.

3. **Return the Result**: The function should return the calculated nonagonal number.

4. **Create an Assertion Function**: You can also define a helper function `is_nonagonal` that checks if a given number is a nonagonal number by calculating the nonagonal numbers up to a certain limit and checking for membership.

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def nonagonal_number(n):
    return n * (7 * n - 5) // 2

def is_nonagonal(num):
    # Check if num is a nonagonal number
    n = 1
    while True:
        nonagonal = nonagonal_number(n)
        if nonagonal == num:
            return True
        elif nonagonal > num:
            return False
        n += 1

# Example usage
assert is_nonagonal(nonagonal_number(10)) == True
assert nonagonal_number(10) == 325
```

In this code:
- The `nonagonal_number` function computes the nth nonagonal number.
- The `is_nonagonal` function checks if a given number is a nonagonal number by generating nonagonal numbers until it either finds the number or surpasses it.

This approach allows you to find and verify nonagonal numbers effectively.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/641 [generation text] Explain: The task requires writing a function to find the nth nonagonal number using the specified formula. The rough plan provided in the context is mostly correct, but it includes an unnecessary helper function for checking if a number is nonagonal, which is not required for the task. The assertion provided in the task directly checks the output of the function, so we only need to implement the function that calculates the nth nonagonal number.

1) Define the function `is_nonagonal` that takes an integer \( n \) as an argument.
2) Implement the formula for the nth nonagonal number: \( P(n) = \frac{n(7n - 5)}{2} \).
