Write a python function to count the number of pairs whose sum is equal to â€˜sumâ€™. The funtion gets as input a list of numbers and the sum,

"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/767 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of counting the number of pairs in a list whose sum equals a specified value, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: You need to find pairs of numbers in the list that add up to a given sum. A pair consists of two elements, and the order of the elements in the pair does not matter (i.e., (a, b) is the same as (b, a)).

2. **Use a Dictionary for Counting**: You can use a dictionary (or a `Counter` from the `collections` module) to keep track of how many times each number appears in the list. This will help you efficiently find how many pairs can be formed.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: For each number in the list, calculate the complement that would sum with the current number to reach the target sum. For example, if the current number is `num`, the complement would be `sum - num`.

4. **Count Valid Pairs**: Check if the complement exists in the dictionary. If it does, you can form pairs with the current number and the complement. The number of pairs that can be formed is determined by the frequency of the complement in the dictionary.

5. **Handle Duplicates**: If the current number and the complement are the same (i.e., when `num` is half of the target sum), you need to handle this case separately to avoid counting the same pair multiple times.

6. **Return the Count**: After iterating through the list and counting all valid pairs, return the total count.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def get_pairs_count(numbers, target_sum):
    count = 0
    num_count = {}
    
    # Count occurrences of each number
    for num in numbers:
        if num in num_count:
            num_count[num] += 1
        else:
            num_count[num] = 1
            
    # Count pairs
    for num in numbers:
        complement = target_sum - num
        if complement in num_count:
            count += num_count[complement]
            # If num and complement are the same, we need to adjust the count
            if complement == num:
                count -= 1  # Avoid double counting the pair (num, num)
    
    # Each pair is counted twice, so divide by 2
    return count // 2
```

This function will correctly count the number of pairs whose sum equals the specified value.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/767 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct and outlines the necessary steps to solve the problem. However, it does not explicitly mention that we need to ensure that pairs are counted correctly, especially when the same number can form pairs with itself. The plan also needs to clarify that we should avoid double counting pairs.

Plan:
1) Create a dictionary to count occurrences of each number in the input list.
2) Iterate through the list of numbers and for each number, calculate its complement that would sum to the target sum.
3) Check if the complement exists in the dictionary and update the count of pairs accordingly.
4) If the number and its complement are the same, adjust the count to avoid double counting.
5) Since each pair is counted twice, divide the final count by 2 before returning it.

Code:
```python
def get_pairs_count(numbers, target_sum):
    count = 0
    num_count = {}
    
    # Count occurrences of each number
    for num in numbers:
        if num in num_count:
            num_count[num] += 1
        else:
            num_count[num] = 1
            
    # Count pairs

            if complement == num:
                count -= 1  # Avoid double counting the pair (num, num)
    
    # Each pair is counted twice, so divide by 2
