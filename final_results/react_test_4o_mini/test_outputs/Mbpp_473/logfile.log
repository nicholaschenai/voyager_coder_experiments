INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/473 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the tuple intersection of elements in the given tuple lists irrespective of their order, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Normalize Tuples**: Since the order of elements in the tuples does not matter, you can convert each tuple into a sorted tuple. This way, `(3, 4)` and `(4, 3)` will be treated as the same tuple.

2. **Use Sets for Uniqueness**: Convert the lists of tuples into sets. This will help in eliminating any duplicate tuples and will also allow for efficient intersection operations.

3. **Find Intersection**: Use the set intersection operation to find common elements between the two sets of tuples.

4. **Return the Result**: The result will be a set of tuples that are present in both input lists.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def tuple_intersection(list1, list2):
    # Normalize tuples by sorting their elements
    normalized_set1 = {tuple(sorted(t)) for t in list1}
    normalized_set2 = {tuple(sorted(t)) for t in list2}
    
    # Find the intersection of the two sets
    intersection = normalized_set1.intersection(normalized_set2)
    
    return intersection
```

In this function:
- We use a set comprehension to create `normalized_set1` and `normalized_set2`, where each tuple is sorted.
- We then use the `intersection` method to find common tuples between the two sets.
- Finally, we return the intersection as a set of tuples.

This approach ensures that the order of elements in the tuples does not affect the outcome, and it efficiently finds the intersection.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
