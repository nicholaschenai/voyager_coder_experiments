"""
Write a python function to reverse an array upto a given position.
assert reverse_Array_Upto_K([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],4) == [4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 6]
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/644 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of reversing an array up to a given position in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `reverse_Array_Upto_K` that takes two parameters: the array (list) and the position (k) up to which you want to reverse the elements.

2. **Slice the Array**: Use Python's list slicing to separate the part of the array that needs to be reversed (from the start of the array to the k-th position) and the part that remains unchanged (from the k-th position to the end of the array).

3. **Reverse the Sliced Part**: Reverse the sliced part of the array. In Python, you can reverse a list using slicing with a step of -1 (e.g., `array[::-1]`).

4. **Combine the Results**: Concatenate the reversed part with the unchanged part to form the final array.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the newly formed array.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def reverse_Array_Upto_K(arr, k):
    # Step 1: Slice the array up to k (exclusive)
    part_to_reverse = arr[:k]
    # Step 2: Reverse the sliced part
    reversed_part = part_to_reverse[::-1]
    # Step 3: Get the remaining part of the array
    remaining_part = arr[k:]
    # Step 4: Combine the reversed part with the remaining part
    result = reversed_part + remaining_part
    # Step 5: Return the result
    return result
```

This function will reverse the elements of the array up to the specified position and return the modified array as required.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of reversing an array up to a given position in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `reverse_Array_Upto_K` that takes two parameters: the array (list) and the position (k) up to which you want to reverse the elements.

2. **Slice the Array**: Use Python's list slicing to separate the part of the array that needs to be reversed (from the start of the array to the k-th position) and the part that remains unchanged (from the k-th position to the end of the array).

    # Step 4: Combine the reversed part with the remaining part
    result = reversed_part + remaining_part
    # Step 5: Return the result

```

This function will reverse the elements of the array up to the specified position and return the modified array as required.

3) Reverse the sliced part using Python's slicing feature.
4) Get the remaining part of the array that comes after the k-th position.
5) Concatenate the reversed part with the remaining part.
