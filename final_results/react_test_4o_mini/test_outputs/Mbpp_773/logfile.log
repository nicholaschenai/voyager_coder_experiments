"""
Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
assert occurance_substring('python programming, python language','python')==('python', 0, 6)
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/773 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the occurrence and position of a substring within a string in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `occurance_substring` that takes two parameters: the main string and the substring you want to search for.

2. **Search for the Substring**: Use the `str.find()` method or `str.index()` method to locate the first occurrence of the substring within the main string. The `find()` method returns the lowest index of the substring if found, or -1 if not found.

3. **Check for Matches**: If the substring is found (i.e., the index is not -1), you can return a tuple containing the substring and its starting and ending positions. The starting position is the index returned by `find()`, and the ending position can be calculated by adding the length of the substring to the starting index.

4. **Return None if No Match**: If the substring is not found, return `None`.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def occurance_substring(main_string, substring):
    start_index = main_string.find(substring)
    if start_index != -1:
        end_index = start_index + len(substring)
        return (substring, start_index, end_index)
    return None
```

In this function:
- `main_string.find(substring)` finds the starting index of the substring.
- If found, the function calculates the ending index and returns the required tuple.
- If not found, it returns `None`.

This approach effectively allows you to find the occurrence and position of a substring within a string.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the occurrence and position of a substring within a string in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `occurance_substring` that takes two parameters: the main string and the substring you want to search for.

2. **Search for the Substring**: Use the `str.find()` method or `str.index()` method to locate the first occurrence of the substring within the main string. The `find()` method returns the lowest index of the substring if found, or -1 if not found.

3. **Check for Matches**: If the substring is found (i.e., the index is not -1), you can return a tuple containing the substring and its starting and ending positions. The starting position is the index returned by `find()`, and the ending position can be calculated by adding the length of the substring to the starting index.

4. **Return None if No Match**: If the substring is not found, return `None`.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def occurance_substring(main_string, substring):
    start_index = main_string.find(substring)
    if start_index != -1:
        end_index = start_index + len(substring)
        return (substring, start_index, end_index)
    return None
```

In this function:
- `main_string.find(substring)` finds the starting index of the substring.
- If found, the function calculates the ending index and returns the required tuple.
- If not found, it returns `None`.

This approach effectively allows you to find the occurrence and position of a substring within a string.
