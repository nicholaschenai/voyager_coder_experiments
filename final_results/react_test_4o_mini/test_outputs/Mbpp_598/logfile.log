INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/598 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.
assert armstrong_number(153)==True
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/598 [generation text] Answer: To check whether a given number is an Armstrong number in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand Armstrong Numbers**: An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because it has 3 digits, and \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153\).

2. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `armstrong_number` that takes a single argument (the number to check).

3. **Convert the Number to String**: Convert the number to a string to easily iterate over each digit.

4. **Calculate the Number of Digits**: Determine the number of digits in the number by using the length of the string representation.

5. **Sum the Powers of the Digits**: Initialize a sum variable to zero. Loop through each digit, convert it back to an integer, raise it to the power of the number of digits, and add it to the sum.

6. **Compare the Sum to the Original Number**: After the loop, check if the calculated sum is equal to the original number. If they are equal, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def armstrong_number(num):
    # Convert the number to string to iterate over digits
    str_num = str(num)
    # Calculate the number of digits
    num_digits = len(str_num)
    # Initialize sum
    sum_of_powers = 0
    # Loop through each digit
    for digit in str_num:
        sum_of_powers += int(digit) ** num_digits
    # Check if the sum of powers equals the original number
    return sum_of_powers == num
```

You can then use the `assert` statement to test the function, as shown in your example.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

The code provided in the critique section is also correct and follows the outlined steps.

Plan:
1) Define the function `armstrong_number` that takes an integer as input.
2) Convert the number to a string to easily access each digit.
3) Calculate the number of digits in the number.
4) Initialize a variable to hold the sum of the digits raised to the power of the number of digits.
5) Loop through each digit, convert it back to an integer, raise it to the power of the number of digits, and add it to the sum.
6) After the loop, check if the calculated sum is equal to the original number and return `True` or `False`.
