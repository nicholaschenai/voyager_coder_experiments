INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/223 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of determining whether a given element is the majority element in a sorted array, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand the Majority Element**: A majority element in an array is defined as an element that appears more than `n/2` times, where `n` is the length of the array.

2. **Utilize the Sorted Property**: Since the array is sorted, all occurrences of the majority element (if it exists) will be contiguous. This means that if the element is the majority, it will occupy a block of positions in the array.

3. **Count Occurrences**: You can find the first and last occurrence of the element in the array. The difference between these two indices will give you the count of occurrences of the element.

4. **Check the Count**: Compare the count of occurrences to `n/2`. If the count is greater than `n/2`, then the element is the majority element.

5. **Implementation**: You can implement this logic in a function that takes the sorted array, its length, and the element to check.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def is_majority(arr, n, element):
    # Find the first occurrence of the element
    first_index = arr.index(element)
    
    # Find the last occurrence of the element
    last_index = len(arr) - 1 - arr[::-1].index(element)
    
    # Calculate the count of occurrences
    count = last_index - first_index + 1
    
    # Check if the count is greater than n/2
    return count > n / 2
```

In this function:
- `arr.index(element)` finds the first occurrence of the element.
- `arr[::-1].index(element)` finds the last occurrence by reversing the array.
- The count is calculated by the difference of indices, and finally, we check if this count is greater than `n/2`.

This approach efficiently determines if the element is the majority element in the sorted array.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of determining whether a given element is the majority element in a sorted array, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand the Majority Element**: A majority element in an array is defined as an element that appears more than `n/2` times, where `n` is the length of the array.

2. **Utilize the Sorted Property**: Since the array is sorted, all occurrences of the majority element (if it exists) will be contiguous. This means that if the element is the majority, it will occupy a block of positions in the array.

3. **Count Occurrences**: You can find the first and last occurrence of the element in the array. The difference between these two indices will give you the count of occurrences of the element.

4. **Check the Count**: Compare the count of occurrences to `n/2`. If the count is greater than `n/2`, then the element is the majority element.

5. **Implementation**: You can implement this logic in a function that takes the sorted array, its length, and the element to check.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def is_majority(arr, n, element):
    # Find the first occurrence of the element
    first_index = arr.index(element)
    
    # Find the last occurrence of the element
    last_index = len(arr) - 1 - arr[::-1].index(element)
    
    # Calculate the count of occurrences
    count = last_index - first_index + 1
    
    # Check if the count is greater than n/2
    return count > n / 2
```

In this function:
- `arr.index(element)` finds the first occurrence of the element.
- `arr[::-1].index(element)` finds the last occurrence by reversing the array.
- The count is calculated by the difference of indices, and finally, we check if this count is greater than `n/2`.

This approach efficiently determines if the element is the majority element in the sorted array.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/223 [generation text] Explain: The plan outlined in the context is mostly correct, but it lacks handling for cases where the element is not present in the array. If the element is not found, the `index` method will raise a `ValueError`. Additionally, the method of finding the last occurrence could be simplified since the array is sorted. We can directly calculate the last index based on the first index and the count of the element.

Plan:
1) Check if the element is present in the array. If not, return `False`.
2) Use the `index` method to find the first occurrence of the element.
3) Calculate the last index based on the first index and the number of occurrences of the element.
4) Calculate the count of occurrences of the element.
5) Compare the count to `n/2` to determine if it is the majority element.
6) Return `True` if it is the majority element, otherwise return `False`.

Code:
```python
def is_majority(arr, n, element):
    if element not in arr:
        return False
    
    first_index = arr.index(element)
    last_index = first_index + arr[first_index:].count(element) - 1
