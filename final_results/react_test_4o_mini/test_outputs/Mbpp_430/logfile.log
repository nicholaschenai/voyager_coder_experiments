"""
Write a function to find the directrix of a parabola.
assert parabola_directrix(5,3,2)==-198
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/430 [generation text] Answer: To find the directrix of a parabola given its standard form, we need to understand the parameters involved. A parabola can be represented in the form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) or in vertex form \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \), where \((h, k)\) is the vertex of the parabola.

The directrix of a parabola is a line that is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry and is located at a distance from the vertex that is equal to the distance from the vertex to the focus. For a parabola that opens upwards or downwards, the directrix can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Directrix} = k - \frac{1}{4p} \]

where \( p \) is the distance from the vertex to the focus. The value of \( p \) can be derived from the coefficient \( a \) in the parabola's equation, specifically:

\[ p = \frac{1}{4a} \]

Given the parameters of the function `parabola_directrix(a, b, c)`, you can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the vertex \((h, k)\) of the parabola using the formulas:
   - \( h = -\frac{b}{2a} \)
   - \( k = f(h) \) where \( f(x) \) is the parabola's equation.

2. Determine the value of \( p \) using \( a \).

3. Calculate the directrix using the formula mentioned above.

4. Return the value of the directrix.

Here is a conceptual implementation of the function:

```python
def parabola_directrix(a, b, c):
    # Step 1: Calculate the vertex (h, k)
    h = -b / (2 * a)
    k = a * h**2 + b * h + c  # f(h)

    # Step 2: Calculate p
    p = 1 / (4 * a)

    # Step 3: Calculate the directrix
    directrix = k - p

    return directrix
```

In this case, you would need to ensure that the function returns the expected value of -198 when called with the parameters (5, 3, 2). You may need to adjust the calculations based on the specific form of the parabola you are working with.

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.

To fix the implementation, ensure that the vertex k is calculated correctly. The formula for k should be based on the vertex coordinates, which is k = a * h^2 + b * h + c. Additionally, ensure that the directrix is calculated as k - p, where p = 1/(4a). After correcting these calculations, the function should return the expected value.

"""
Write a function to find the directrix of a parabola.
assert parabola_directrix(5,3,2)==-198
"""

[Context]: 
 Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To find the directrix of a parabola given its standard form, we need to understand the parameters involved. A parabola can be represented in the form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) or in vertex form \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \), where \((h, k)\) is the vertex of the parabola.

The directrix of a parabola is a line that is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry and is located at a distance from the vertex that is equal to the distance from the vertex to the focus. For a parabola that opens upwards or downwards, the directrix can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Directrix} = k - \frac{1}{4p} \]

where \( p \) is the distance from the vertex to the focus. The value of \( p \) can be derived from the coefficient \( a \) in the parabola's equation, specifically:

\[ p = \frac{1}{4a} \]

Given the parameters of the function `parabola_directrix(a, b, c)`, you can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the vertex \((h, k)\) of the parabola using the formulas:
   - \( h = -\frac{b}{2a} \)
   - \( k = f(h) \) where \( f(x) \) is the parabola's equation.

2. Determine the value of \( p \) using \( a \).

3. Calculate the directrix using the formula mentioned above.

4. Return the value of the directrix.

Here is a conceptual implementation of the function:

```python
def parabola_directrix(a, b, c):
    # Step 1: Calculate the vertex (h, k)
    h = -b / (2 * a)
    k = a * h**2 + b * h + c  # f(h)

    # Step 2: Calculate p
    p = 1 / (4 * a)

    # Step 3: Calculate the directrix
    directrix = k - p

    return directrix
```

In this case, you would need to ensure that the function returns the expected value of -198 when called with the parameters (5, 3, 2). You may need to adjust the calculations based on the specific form of the parabola you are working with.


[function impl]:


def parabola_directrix(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:
    h = ((- b) / (2 * a))
    k = (((a * (h ** 2)) + (b * h)) + c)
    p = (1 / (4 * a))
    directrix = (k - p)
    return int(directrix)

[Context]: 
 Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To find the directrix of a parabola given its standard form, we need to understand the parameters involved. A parabola can be represented in the form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) or in vertex form \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \), where \((h, k)\) is the vertex of the parabola.

The directrix of a parabola is a line that is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry and is located at a distance from the vertex that is equal to the distance from the vertex to the focus. For a parabola that opens upwards or downwards, the directrix can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Directrix} = k - \frac{1}{4p} \]

where \( p \) is the distance from the vertex to the focus. The value of \( p \) can be derived from the coefficient \( a \) in the parabola's equation, specifically:

\[ p = \frac{1}{4a} \]

Given the parameters of the function `parabola_directrix(a, b, c)`, you can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the vertex \((h, k)\) of the parabola using the formulas:
   - \( h = -\frac{b}{2a} \)
   - \( k = f(h) \) where \( f(x) \) is the parabola's equation.

2. Determine the value of \( p \) using \( a \).

3. Calculate the directrix using the formula mentioned above.

4. Return the value of the directrix.

Here is a conceptual implementation of the function:

```python
def parabola_directrix(a, b, c):
    # Step 1: Calculate the vertex (h, k)
    h = -b / (2 * a)
    k = a * h**2 + b * h + c  # f(h)

    # Step 2: Calculate p
    p = 1 / (4 * a)

    # Step 3: Calculate the directrix
    directrix = k - p

    return directrix
```

In this case, you would need to ensure that the function returns the expected value of -198 when called with the parameters (5, 3, 2). You may need to adjust the calculations based on the specific form of the parabola you are working with.

To fix the implementation, ensure that the vertex k is calculated correctly. The formula for k should be based on the vertex coordinates, which is k = a * h^2 + b * h + c.

    "reasoning": "The implementation failed the test case because the calculated directrix does not match the expected value of -198. The formula used to calculate the directrix seems to be incorrect, particularly in how the vertex and the distance to the focus are computed. The directrix should be calculated as k - p, but the value of k is not being computed correctly due to the order of operations and the formula used.",
    "success": false,
    "critique": "To fix the implementation, ensure that the vertex k is calculated correctly. The formula for k should be based on the vertex coordinates, which is k = a * h^2 + b * h + c. Additionally, ensure that the directrix is calculated as k - p, where p = 1/(4a). After correcting these calculations, the function should return the expected value."
