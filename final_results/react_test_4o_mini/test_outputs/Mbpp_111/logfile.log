INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/111 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding common elements in given nested lists in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand the Input**: You have a list of lists (nested lists) where each inner list contains integers. Your goal is to identify the elements that are present in all of these inner lists.

2. **Use Sets for Intersection**: Sets in Python are a great way to handle this problem because they allow for efficient membership testing and provide an easy way to find common elements using intersection.

3. **Initialize the Common Elements**: Start by converting the first inner list into a set. This will serve as the initial set of common elements.

4. **Iterate Through Remaining Lists**: For each of the remaining inner lists, convert them into sets and perform an intersection with the current set of common elements. This will update the common elements to only those that are present in both sets.

5. **Return the Result**: After processing all inner lists, the resulting set will contain only the elements that are common to all lists. You can then convert this set back to a list if needed.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def common_in_nested_lists(nested_lists):
    # Start with the first list as a set
    common_elements = set(nested_lists[0])
    
    # Iterate through the rest of the lists
    for inner_list in nested_lists[1:]:
        # Update common_elements to the intersection with the current list
        common_elements.intersection_update(inner_list)
    
    # Return the common elements as a set or list
    return common_elements
```

This function will effectively find and return the common elements across all the nested lists. The use of `intersection_update` ensures that `common_elements` is updated in place, maintaining only those elements that are found in all lists.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/111 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct and outlines the necessary steps to find common elements in nested lists. However, it does not explicitly mention the need to convert the final set of common elements back to a list, as the assertion checks for a set comparison. The function should return a list of common elements instead of a set.

Plan:
1) Define the function `common_in_nested_lists` that takes a list of lists as input.
2) Convert the first inner list into a set to initialize the common elements.
3) Iterate through the remaining inner lists, converting each to a set and updating the common elements using the intersection.
4) Convert the final set of common elements to a list and return it.

```python
