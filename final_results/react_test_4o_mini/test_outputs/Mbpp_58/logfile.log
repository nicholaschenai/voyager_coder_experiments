INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/58 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a python function to check whether the given two integers have opposite sign or not.
assert opposite_Signs(1,-2) == True
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/58 [generation text] Answer: To check whether two integers have opposite signs in Python, you can use the following conceptual approach:

1. **Understanding Sign**: An integer is considered to have a positive sign if it is greater than zero, and a negative sign if it is less than zero. Zero itself is neither positive nor negative.

2. **Using Multiplication**: One effective way to determine if two integers have opposite signs is to multiply them. If the product of the two integers is negative, it indicates that one integer is positive and the other is negative.

3. **Function Definition**: You can define a function named `opposite_Signs` that takes two integers as parameters.

4. **Return Value**: The function should return `True` if the product of the two integers is less than zero (indicating opposite signs), and `False` otherwise.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def opposite_Signs(a, b):
    return a * b < 0
```

5. **Testing the Function**: You can use an assertion to test the function, as shown in the example provided.

By following these steps, you can effectively determine if two integers have opposite signs in Python.

Here are some useful functions written earlier which you can reuse or reference.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/58 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is correct and outlines a valid approach to determine if two integers have opposite signs. The multiplication method is a straightforward way to check the signs of the integers. The function name and the expected output are also clearly defined in the task.

Plan:
1) Define the function `opposite_Signs` that takes two integer parameters.
2) Use the multiplication method to check if the product of the two integers is less than zero.
3) Return `True` if the product is negative (indicating opposite signs), and `False` otherwise.
