INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/251 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function that takes in a list and an element and inserts the element before each element in the list, and returns the resulting list.
assert insert_element(['Red', 'Green', 'Black'] ,'c')==['c', 'Red', 'c', 'Green', 'c', 'Black']
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/251 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of inserting an element before each element in a list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function that takes two parameters: the list and the element to be inserted.

2. **Initialize a New List**: Create an empty list that will hold the resulting elements.

3. **Iterate Through the Original List**: Use a loop to go through each element in the input list.

4. **Insert the Element**: For each element in the original list, append the specified element followed by the current element to the new list.

5. **Return the New List**: After the loop completes, return the new list that contains the inserted elements.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def insert_element(lst, element):
    result = []
    for item in lst:
        result.append(element)  # Insert the specified element
        result.append(item)     # Insert the current item from the original list
    return result
```

With this function, calling `insert_element(['Red', 'Green', 'Black'], 'c')` will yield `['c', 'Red', 'c', 'Green', 'c', 'Black']`, as required by the assertion.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

Answer: To accomplish the task of inserting an element before each element in a list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function that takes two parameters: the list and the element to be inserted.

2. **Initialize a New List**: Create an empty list that will hold the resulting elements.

3. **Iterate Through the Original List**: Use a loop to go through each element in the input list.

4. **Insert the Element**: For each element in the original list, append the specified element followed by the current element to the new list.

5. **Return the New List**: After the loop completes, return the new list that contains the inserted elements.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def insert_element(lst, element):
    result = []
    for item in lst:
        result.append(element)  # Insert the specified element
        result.append(item)     # Insert the current item from the original list
    return result
```

With this function, calling `insert_element(['Red', 'Green', 'Black'], 'c')` will yield `['c', 'Red', 'c', 'Green', 'c', 'Black']`, as required by the assertion.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/251 [generation text] Explain: The provided plan and code implementation are correct and align with the task requirements. The function `insert_element` is designed to take a list and an element, then insert the element before each item in the list, returning the modified list. The logic is sound, and the function should pass the assertion when executed.

Plan:
1) Define the function `insert_element` that takes two parameters: a list and an element.
2) Initialize an empty list called `result` to store the new elements.
3) Iterate through each item in the input list.
4) For each item, append the specified element followed by the current item to the `result` list.
5) Return the `result` list after the loop completes.

Code:
```python
def insert_element(lst, element):
    result = []
    for item in lst:
        result.append(element)  # Insert the specified element
        result.append(item)     # Insert the current item from the original list
