"""
Write a python function to reverse only the vowels of a given string (where y is not a vowel).
assert reverse_vowels("Python") == "Python"
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/131 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of reversing only the vowels in a given string in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Identify Vowels**: Define a set of characters that represent vowels. In this case, the vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' (both uppercase and lowercase).

2. **Extract Vowels**: Iterate through the string and collect all the vowels in a list. This will allow you to reverse them easily.

3. **Reverse the Vowels**: Once you have the list of vowels, reverse it. This can be done using Python's list slicing or the `reverse()` method.

4. **Reconstruct the String**: Create a new string by iterating through the original string again. For each character, check if it is a vowel. If it is, replace it with the next vowel from the reversed list; if not, keep the character as it is.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the newly constructed string.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def reverse_vowels(s):
    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
    vowel_list = [char for char in s if char in vowels]  # Step 2
    vowel_list.reverse()  # Step 3
    
    result = []
    vowel_index = 0
    
    for char in s:  # Step 4
        if char in vowels:
            result.append(vowel_list[vowel_index])  # Replace with reversed vowel
            vowel_index += 1
        else:
            result.append(char)  # Keep the original character
    
    return ''.join(result)  # Step 5
```

This function will reverse only the vowels in the input string while keeping the positions of the consonants unchanged.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/131 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided in the context is correct and outlines the necessary steps to reverse only the vowels in a given string. The function should identify vowels, extract and reverse them, and then reconstruct the string with the reversed vowels in their original positions. The assertion provided in the task specifies that the function must return the original string if there are no vowels to reverse, which is also handled correctly in the plan.

Plan:
1) Define a set of characters that represent vowels (both uppercase and lowercase).
2) Extract all the vowels from the input string and store them in a list.
3) Reverse the list of extracted vowels.
4) Iterate through the original string and construct a new string, replacing vowels with those from the reversed list while keeping consonants in their original positions.
5) Return the newly constructed string.
