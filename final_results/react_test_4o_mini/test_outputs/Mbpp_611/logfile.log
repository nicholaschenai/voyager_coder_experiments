"""
Write a function which given a matrix represented as a list of lists returns the max of the n'th column.

"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/611 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the maximum value in the nth column of a matrix represented as a list of lists in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function that takes two parameters: the matrix (a list of lists) and the column index (n).

2. **Extract the Column**: Use a list comprehension or a loop to iterate through each row of the matrix and collect the elements that belong to the nth column.

3. **Find the Maximum**: Use the built-in `max()` function to find the maximum value from the extracted column values.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the maximum value found.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def max_of_nth(matrix, n):
    # Step 2: Extract the nth column
    column_values = [row[n] for row in matrix]
    
    # Step 3: Find the maximum value in the column
    max_value = max(column_values)
    
    # Step 4: Return the maximum value
    return max_value
```

This function will correctly return the maximum value from the specified column of the matrix when called with the appropriate arguments.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the maximum value in the nth column of a matrix represented as a list of lists in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function that takes two parameters: the matrix (a list of lists) and the column index (n).

This function will correctly return the maximum value from the specified column of the matrix when called with the appropriate arguments.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/611 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided in the context is mostly correct and outlines the necessary steps to achieve the task. The function needs to be defined with the correct name and types, and it should handle the extraction of the nth column and finding the maximum value properly.

Plan:
1) Define the function `max_of_nth` that takes a matrix (list of lists) and an integer n (the column index).
2) Use a list comprehension to extract the elements from the nth column of the matrix.
3) Use the built-in `max()` function to find the maximum value from the extracted column values.
4) Return the maximum value.

Code:
```python
def max_of_nth(matrix: list[list[int]], n: int) -> int:
    column_values = [row[n] for row in matrix]
    max_value = max(column_values)
    return max_value
