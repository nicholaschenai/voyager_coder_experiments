INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/92 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to check whether the given number is undulating or not.
assert is_undulating(1212121) == True
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/92 [generation text] Answer: To determine if a number is undulating, we need to check if its digits alternate between two different values. An undulating number will have a pattern where no two adjacent digits are the same.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual approach to accomplish this task in Python:

1. **Convert the Number to a String**: This allows us to easily access each digit individually.

2. **Iterate Through the Digits**: Loop through the digits of the number, comparing each digit to the next one.

3. **Check for Adjacent Duplicates**: During the iteration, if any two adjacent digits are the same, the number is not undulating, and we can return `False`.

4. **Return True if All Checks Pass**: If we complete the loop without finding any adjacent duplicates, we return `True`, indicating that the number is undulating.

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of the above logic:

```python
def is_undulating(number):
    num_str = str(number)  # Convert the number to a string
    for i in range(len(num_str) - 1):
        if num_str[i] == num_str[i + 1]:  # Check adjacent digits
            return False  # Not undulating
    return True  # It is undulating

# Example usage
assert is_undulating(1212121) == True
```

This function checks the undulating property of the number by ensuring that no two adjacent digits are the same.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To determine if a number is undulating, we need to check if its digits alternate between two different values. An undulating number will have a pattern where no two adjacent digits are the same.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual approach to accomplish this task in Python:

1. **Convert the Number to a String**: This allows us to easily access each digit individually.

2. **Iterate Through the Digits**: Loop through the digits of the number, comparing each digit to the next one.

3. **Check for Adjacent Duplicates**: During the iteration, if any two adjacent digits are the same, the number is not undulating, and we can return `False`.

4. **Return True if All Checks Pass**: If we complete the loop without finding any adjacent duplicates, we return `True`, indicating that the number is undulating.

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of the above logic:

```python
def is_undulating(number):
    num_str = str(number)  # Convert the number to a string
    for i in range(len(num_str) - 1):
        if num_str[i] == num_str[i + 1]:  # Check adjacent digits
            return False  # Not undulating
    return True  # It is undulating

# Example usage
assert is_undulating(1212121) == True
```

This function checks the undulating property of the number by ensuring that no two adjacent digits are the same.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/92 [generation text] Explain: The provided plan and code correctly outline the steps needed to determine if a number is undulating. The function checks for adjacent digits and returns `False` if any are the same, otherwise it returns `True`. The implementation is straightforward and adheres to the requirements specified in the task.

Plan:
1) Convert the input number to a string to facilitate easy digit comparison.
2) Iterate through the string representation of the number, comparing each digit with the next one.
3) If any two adjacent digits are found to be the same, return `False`.
4) If the loop completes without finding any adjacent duplicates, return `True`.

Code:
```python
def is_undulating(number: int) -> bool:
    num_str = str(number)  # Convert the number to a string
    for i in range(len(num_str) - 1):
        if num_str[i] == num_str[i + 1]:  # Check adjacent digits
