INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/391 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of converting multiple lists into a nested dictionary in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function named `convert_list_dictionary` that takes three lists as parameters.

2. **Iterate Over the Lists**: Use a loop to iterate over the indices of the lists. Since all lists are expected to be of the same length, you can use the `range` function based on the length of one of the lists.

3. **Create Nested Dictionaries**: For each index, create a dictionary where the key is the element from the first list (e.g., student ID), and the value is another dictionary. This inner dictionary will have the name from the second list as the key and the score from the third list as the value.

4. **Collect Results**: Append each of these nested dictionaries to a result list.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the list of nested dictionaries.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def convert_list_dictionary(ids, names, scores):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(ids)):
        nested_dict = {ids[i]: {names[i]: scores[i]}}
        result.append(nested_dict)
    return result
```

This function will take the three lists and produce the desired nested dictionary structure as specified in the assertion.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of converting multiple lists into a nested dictionary in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function named `convert_list_dictionary` that takes three lists as parameters.

2. **Iterate Over the Lists**: Use a loop to iterate over the indices of the lists. Since all lists are expected to be of the same length, you can use the `range` function based on the length of one of the lists.

3. **Create Nested Dictionaries**: For each index, create a dictionary where the key is the element from the first list (e.g., student ID), and the value is another dictionary. This inner dictionary will have the name from the second list as the key and the score from the third list as the value.

4. **Collect Results**: Append each of these nested dictionaries to a result list.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the list of nested dictionaries.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def convert_list_dictionary(ids, names, scores):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(ids)):
        nested_dict = {ids[i]: {names[i]: scores[i]}}
        result.append(nested_dict)
    return result
```

This function will take the three lists and produce the desired nested dictionary structure as specified in the assertion.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/391 [generation text] Explain: The provided plan is clear and outlines the necessary steps to convert multiple lists into a nested dictionary format. The function definition and logic are correctly structured to achieve the desired output. There are no missing steps, and the code should complete the task as specified.

Plan:
1) Define the function `convert_list_dictionary` that takes three lists as parameters: `ids`, `names`, and `scores`.
2) Initialize an empty list called `result` to store the nested dictionaries.
3) Use a for loop to iterate over the indices of the lists, assuming all lists are of the same length.
4) For each index, create a nested dictionary where the key is the student ID from the `ids` list, and the value is another dictionary containing the name from the `names` list as the key and the score from the `scores` list as the value.
5) Append each nested dictionary to the `result` list.
6) Return the `result` list.

Code:
```python
def convert_list_dictionary(ids, names, scores):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(ids)):
