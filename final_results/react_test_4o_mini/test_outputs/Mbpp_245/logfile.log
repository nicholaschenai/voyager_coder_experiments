"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/245 [generation text] Answer: To solve the problem of finding the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence in an array, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understanding Bitonic Subsequences**: A bitonic subsequence is one that first increases and then decreases. For example, in the array `[1, 15, 51, 45, 33, 100, 12, 18, 9]`, a bitonic subsequence could be `[1, 15, 51, 100, 12]`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: You can use dynamic programming to efficiently compute the maximum sum of bitonic subsequences. The idea is to break the problem into two parts:
   - Find the maximum sum of increasing subsequences (from the start to each index).
   - Find the maximum sum of decreasing subsequences (from each index to the end).

3. **Step-by-Step Implementation**:
   - **Calculate Maximum Sum of Increasing Subsequences**: Create an array `inc_sum` where `inc_sum[i]` holds the maximum sum of increasing subsequences that end at index `i`. For each element, check all previous elements and update `inc_sum[i]` accordingly.
   - **Calculate Maximum Sum of Decreasing Subsequences**: Similarly, create an array `dec_sum` where `dec_sum[i]` holds the maximum sum of decreasing subsequences that start at index `i`. This can be done in a similar manner but iterating from the end of the array to the start.
   - **Combine Results**: The maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence that peaks at index `i` can be calculated as `inc_sum[i] + dec_sum[i] - arr[i]` (subtracting `arr[i]` to avoid double counting the peak element). Iterate through all indices to find the maximum value.

4. **Final Function**: Implement the above logic in a function that takes the array as input and returns the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence.

Here is a high-level outline of the function:

```python
def max_sum(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n == 0:
        return 0

    # Step 1: Calculate increasing subsequence sums
    inc_sum = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        inc_sum[i] = arr[i]
        for j in range(i):
            if arr[j] < arr[i]:
                inc_sum[i] = max(inc_sum[i], inc_sum[j] + arr[i])

    # Step 2: Calculate decreasing subsequence sums
    dec_sum = [0] * n
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        dec_sum[i] = arr[i]
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if arr[j] < arr[i]:
                dec_sum[i] = max(dec_sum[i], dec_sum[j] + arr[i])

    # Step 3: Combine results to find the maximum bitonic sum
    max_bitonic_sum = 0
    for i in range(n):
        max_bitonic_sum = max(max_bitonic_sum, inc_sum[i] + dec_sum[i] - arr[i])

    return max_bitonic_sum
```

5. **Testing the Function**: Finally, you can test the function with the provided assertion to ensure it works correctly.

By following these steps, you can effectively find the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence in a given array.

At each round of conversation, I will give you

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.
