    "reasoning": "The implementation failed the test case because it returned 15000 instead of the expected 3000. This indicates that the logic for calculating the maximum product of increasing subsequences is incorrect.",
    "success": false,
    "critique": "The issue arises from the initialization of the `max_product` array. It should be initialized with the values of the input array instead of 1. This is because the maximum product of an increasing subsequence that ends at each index should start with the value of the element itself. Additionally, the logic for updating the `max_product` array is correct, but the initialization needs to be fixed to reflect the actual values of the array."
