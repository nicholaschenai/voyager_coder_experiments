"""
Write a function to check if the given expression is balanced or not. 
assert check_expression("{()}[{}]") == True
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/771 [generation text] Answer: To check if a given expression is balanced in Python, you can use a stack data structure. The concept behind this approach is to traverse the expression character by character and use the stack to keep track of opening brackets. Here's a conceptual breakdown of the steps involved:

1. **Initialize a Stack**: Create an empty list to serve as the stack.

2. **Define Matching Pairs**: Create a dictionary that maps each closing bracket to its corresponding opening bracket. For example, `')'` maps to `'('`, `'}'` maps to `'{'`, and `']'` maps to `'['`.

3. **Iterate Through the Expression**: Loop through each character in the expression:
   - If the character is an opening bracket (i.e., `'{'`, `'('`, or `'['`), push it onto the stack.
   - If the character is a closing bracket (i.e., `'}'`, `')'`, or `']'`):
     - Check if the stack is empty. If it is, the expression is unbalanced (there's no matching opening bracket).
     - If the stack is not empty, pop the top element from the stack and check if it matches the corresponding opening bracket for the current closing bracket. If it doesn't match, the expression is unbalanced.

4. **Final Check**: After processing all characters, check if the stack is empty. If it is empty, the expression is balanced; if not, it is unbalanced.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic:

```python
def check_expression(expression):
    stack = []
    matching_brackets = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}
    
    for char in expression:
        if char in matching_brackets.values():  # If it's an opening bracket
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in matching_brackets.keys():  # If it's a closing bracket
            if not stack or stack.pop() != matching_brackets[char]:
                return False
    
    return len(stack) == 0  # Return True if stack is empty, else False

# Example usage
assert check_expression("{()}[{}]") == True
```

This function will correctly determine if the brackets in the expression are balanced.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
