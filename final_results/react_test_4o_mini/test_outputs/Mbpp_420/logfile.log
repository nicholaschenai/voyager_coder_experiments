INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/420 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a python function to find the cube sum of first n even natural numbers.
assert cube_Sum(2) == 72
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/420 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand Even Natural Numbers**: The first n even natural numbers are 2, 4, 6, ..., 2n. You can generate these numbers using a loop or a list comprehension.

2. **Calculate the Cube**: For each even number, calculate its cube. The cube of a number x is given by \(x^3\) or `x ** 3` in Python.

3. **Sum the Cubes**: Initialize a variable to hold the sum of the cubes. As you calculate the cube of each even number, add it to this sum.

4. **Return the Result**: After processing all n even numbers, return the total sum.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def cube_Sum(n):
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        even_number = 2 * i  # Generate the ith even number
        total_sum += even_number ** 3  # Add the cube of the even number to the total sum
    return total_sum
```

In this function:
- We loop from 1 to n.
- For each iteration, we calculate the ith even number and its cube.
- We accumulate the cubes in `total_sum` and return it at the end.

This function should satisfy the assertion `assert cube_Sum(2) == 72`, as the first two even natural numbers are 2 and 4, and their cubes are \(2^3 = 8\) and \(4^3 = 64\), which sum to 72.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

[Task]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to find the cube sum of first n even natural numbers.
assert cube_Sum(2) == 72
"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand Even Natural Numbers**: The first n even natural numbers are 2, 4, 6, ..., 2n. You can generate these numbers using a loop or a list comprehension.

2. **Calculate the Cube**: For each even number, calculate its cube. The cube of a number x is given by \(x^3\) or `x ** 3` in Python.

3. **Sum the Cubes**: Initialize a variable to hold the sum of the cubes. As you calculate the cube of each even number, add it to this sum.

4. **Return the Result**: After processing all n even numbers, return the total sum.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def cube_Sum(n):
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        even_number = 2 * i  # Generate the ith even number
        total_sum += even_number ** 3  # Add the cube of the even number to the total sum
    return total_sum
```

In this function:
- We loop from 1 to n.
- For each iteration, we calculate the ith even number and its cube.
- We accumulate the cubes in `total_sum` and return it at the end.

This function should satisfy the assertion `assert cube_Sum(2) == 72`, as the first two even natural numbers are 2 and 4, and their cubes are \(2^3 = 8\) and \(4^3 = 64\), which sum to 72.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/420 [generation text] Explain: The provided conceptual outline is correct and follows the necessary steps to compute the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers. The function correctly generates the even numbers, calculates their cubes, and sums them up. The assertion `assert cube_Sum(2) == 72` will pass as the calculation is accurate.

Plan:
1) Define the function `cube_Sum` that takes an integer `n` as input.
2) Initialize a variable `total_sum` to 0 to hold the cumulative sum of the cubes.
3) Use a loop to iterate from 1 to `n`, generating the ith even number as `2 * i`.
4) For each even number, calculate its cube and add it to `total_sum`.
5) Return `total_sum` after the loop completes.

Code:
```python
def cube_Sum(n: int) -> int:
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        even_number = 2 * i  # Generate the ith even number
