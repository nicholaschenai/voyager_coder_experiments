"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/615 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of calculating the average value for each tuple within a tuple of tuples in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function named `average_tuple` that takes a single argument, which is expected to be a tuple of tuples.

2. **Initialize a List for Averages**: Inside the function, create an empty list that will hold the average values for each inner tuple.

3. **Iterate Over the Outer Tuple**: Use a loop to iterate over each inner tuple in the outer tuple.

4. **Calculate the Average**: For each inner tuple, calculate the average by:
   - Summing the elements of the tuple using the `sum()` function.
   - Dividing the sum by the number of elements in the tuple (which can be found using the `len()` function).

5. **Store the Average**: Append the calculated average to the list you initialized earlier.

6. **Return the List**: After processing all inner tuples, return the list containing the average values.

Here is a conceptual outline of the code:

```python
def average_tuple(tuples):
    averages = []  # Step 2: Initialize a list for averages
    for inner_tuple in tuples:  # Step 3: Iterate over each inner tuple
        avg = sum(inner_tuple) / len(inner_tuple)  # Step 4: Calculate the average
        averages.append(avg)  # Step 5: Store the average
    return averages  # Step 6: Return the list of averages
```

This function will then be able to compute the average values as specified in the assertion example provided.

You are a Python programming assistant that assesses my progress of Python programming and provides useful guidance.

[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

[Critique]
The issue arises from the fact that the function is not correctly summing the elements of each inner tuple. The current implementation is likely summing the first element of each inner tuple multiple times or not iterating through all elements correctly. To fix this, ensure that the function correctly iterates through each inner tuple and sums all its elements before dividing by the length of that tuple.


INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/615 [generation text] Explain: The current implementation of the `average_tuple` function is incorrectly calculating the averages. It is summing the elements of each inner tuple but not correctly handling the structure of the input. The function should calculate the average for each inner tuple and return a list of these averages. The assertion failed because the output did not match the expected averages.

Plan:
1) Define the function `average_tuple` that takes a tuple of tuples as input.
2) Initialize an empty list to store the average values.
3) Iterate over each inner tuple in the input tuple.
4) For each inner tuple, calculate the average by summing its elements and dividing by the number of elements.

[Context]: 
 Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of calculating the average value for each tuple within a tuple of tuples in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function named `average_tuple` that takes a single argument, which is expected to be a tuple of tuples.

2. **Initialize a List for Averages**: Inside the function, create an empty list that will hold the average values for each inner tuple.

3. **Iterate Over the Outer Tuple**: Use a loop to iterate over each inner tuple in the outer tuple.

4. **Calculate the Average**: For each inner tuple, calculate the average by:
   - Summing the elements of the tuple using the `sum()` function.
   - Dividing the sum by the number of elements in the tuple (which can be found using the `len()` function).

5. **Store the Average**: Append the calculated average to the list you initialized earlier.

6. **Return the List**: After processing all inner tuples, return the list containing the average values.

Here is a conceptual outline of the code:

```python
def average_tuple(tuples):
    averages = []  # Step 2: Initialize a list for averages
    for inner_tuple in tuples:  # Step 3: Iterate over each inner tuple
        avg = sum(inner_tuple) / len(inner_tuple)  # Step 4: Calculate the average
        averages.append(avg)  # Step 5: Store the average
    return averages  # Step 6: Return the list of averages
```

This function will then be able to compute the average values as specified in the assertion example provided.

The issue arises from the fact that the function is not correctly summing the elements of each inner tuple. The current implementation is likely summing the first element of each inner tuple multiple times or not iterating through all elements correctly. To fix this, ensure that the function correctly iterates through each inner tuple and sums all its elements before dividing by the length of that tuple.

You are a Python programming assistant that assesses my progress of Python programming and provides useful guidance.

[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)
