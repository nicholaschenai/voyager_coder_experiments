"""
Write a function to find the cumulative sum of all the values that are present in the given tuple list.
assert cummulative_sum([(1, 3), (5, 6, 7), (2, 6)]) == 30
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/614 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the cumulative sum of all the values in a given list of tuples in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a list of tuples as an argument.

2. **Initialize a Sum Variable**: Inside the function, initialize a variable to hold the cumulative sum, starting at zero.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to iterate through each tuple in the list.

4. **Iterate Through Each Tuple**: For each tuple, use another loop to iterate through its elements.

5. **Accumulate the Sum**: For each element in the tuple, add its value to the cumulative sum variable.

6. **Return the Result**: After processing all tuples, return the cumulative sum.

Here is a conceptual outline of the code:

```python
def cumulative_sum(tuple_list):
    total = 0  # Step 2: Initialize sum variable
    for tup in tuple_list:  # Step 3: Iterate through the list of tuples
        for value in tup:  # Step 4: Iterate through each tuple
            total += value  # Step 5: Accumulate the sum
    return total  # Step 6: Return the result
```

You can then use this function and assert the result as shown in your example. This approach effectively combines iteration and accumulation to achieve the desired outcome.

Plan:
1) Define the function `cumulative_sum` that takes a list of tuples as an argument.
2) Initialize a variable `total` to zero to hold the cumulative sum.
3) Use a for loop to iterate through each tuple in the input list.
4) Inside the loop, use another for loop to iterate through each value in the current tuple.
5) Add each value to the `total` variable.
6) After processing all tuples, return the `total`.
