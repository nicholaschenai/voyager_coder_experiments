INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/762 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. Months are given as number from 1 to 12.
assert check_monthnumber_number(6)==True
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/762 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of checking whether a given month number contains 30 days, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `check_monthnumber_number` that takes a single parameter, which will be the month number (an integer from 1 to 12).

2. **Identify Months with 30 Days**: Determine which months have 30 days. The months that have 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11).

3. **Check the Month Number**: Inside the function, use a conditional statement to check if the provided month number is one of the months that have 30 days.

4. **Return the Result**: If the month number corresponds to one of the months with 30 days, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.

5. **Testing the Function**: Use an assertion to test the function, as shown in the example provided.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def check_monthnumber_number(month):
    # List of months with 30 days
    months_with_30_days = [4, 6, 9, 11]
    
    # Check if the month is in the list
    return month in months_with_30_days

# Example assertion
assert check_monthnumber_number(6) == True
```

This function checks if the input month is in the predefined list of months that have 30 days and returns the appropriate boolean value.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Task]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. Months are given as number from 1 to 12.
assert check_monthnumber_number(6)==True
"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of checking whether a given month number contains 30 days, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `check_monthnumber_number` that takes a single parameter, which will be the month number (an integer from 1 to 12).

2. **Identify Months with 30 Days**: Determine which months have 30 days. The months that have 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11).

3. **Check the Month Number**: Inside the function, use a conditional statement to check if the provided month number is one of the months that have 30 days.

4. **Return the Result**: If the month number corresponds to one of the months with 30 days, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.

5. **Testing the Function**: Use an assertion to test the function, as shown in the example provided.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def check_monthnumber_number(month):
    # List of months with 30 days
    months_with_30_days = [4, 6, 9, 11]
    
    # Check if the month is in the list
    return month in months_with_30_days

# Example assertion
assert check_monthnumber_number(6) == True
```

This function checks if the input month is in the predefined list of months that have 30 days and returns the appropriate boolean value.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/762 [generation text] Explain: The plan provided in the context is correct and outlines the necessary steps to implement the function. The function will check if a given month number corresponds to a month that has 30 days. The months with 30 days are correctly identified as April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). The assertion provided will test the function to ensure it works as expected.

Plan:
1) Define the function `check_monthnumber_number` that takes an integer parameter `month`.
2) Create a list of months that have 30 days: `[4, 6, 9, 11]`.
3) Use a conditional statement to check if the input month is in the list of months with 30 days.
4) Return `True` if the month is in the list, otherwise return `False`.
5) Include the assertion to test the function.
