    "reasoning": "The implementation failed the test case because the function is expecting two float arguments for the real and imaginary parts, but the test case is passing a complex number (1j) as the imaginary part instead of a float. This leads to a TypeError when trying to compute the angle using math.atan2.",
    "success": false,
    "critique": "To fix the implementation, you should pass the imaginary part as a float instead of a complex number. For example, use angle_complex(0, 1) instead of angle_complex(0, 1j) in the test case. Additionally, ensure that the function is tested with appropriate float values for both the real and imaginary parts."
