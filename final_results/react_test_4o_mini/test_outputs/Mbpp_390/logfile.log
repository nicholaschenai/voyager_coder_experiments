INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/390 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to apply a given format string to all of the elements in a list.
assert add_string([1,2,3,4],'temp{0}')==['temp1', 'temp2', 'temp3', 'temp4']
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/390 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of applying a given format string to all elements in a list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `add_string` that takes two parameters: a list of elements and a format string.

2. **Iterate Over the List**: Use a loop (like a list comprehension or a for loop) to iterate over each element in the provided list.

3. **Format Each Element**: For each element, use the format string to create a new string. You can use the `str.format()` method or an f-string (if using Python 3.6 or later) to insert the element into the format string.

4. **Collect Results**: Store the formatted strings in a new list.

5. **Return the New List**: Finally, return the list of formatted strings.

Here is a conceptual example of how the function might look:

```python
def add_string(elements, format_string):
    return [format_string.format(element) for element in elements]
```

In this example, the function uses a list comprehension to apply the format string to each element in the list, resulting in a new list of formatted strings. The `format()` method is used to insert the current element into the format string.

When you call `add_string([1, 2, 3, 4], 'temp{0}')`, it will return `['temp1', 'temp2', 'temp3', 'temp4']`, as expected.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of applying a given format string to all elements in a list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `add_string` that takes two parameters: a list of elements and a format string.

2. **Iterate Over the List**: Use a loop (like a list comprehension or a for loop) to iterate over each element in the provided list.

3. **Format Each Element**: For each element, use the format string to create a new string. You can use the `str.format()` method or an f-string (if using Python 3.6 or later) to insert the element into the format string.

4. **Collect Results**: Store the formatted strings in a new list.

5. **Return the New List**: Finally, return the list of formatted strings.

Here is a conceptual example of how the function might look:

```python
def add_string(elements, format_string):
    return [format_string.format(element) for element in elements]
```

In this example, the function uses a list comprehension to apply the format string to each element in the list, resulting in a new list of formatted strings. The `format()` method is used to insert the current element into the format string.

When you call `add_string([1, 2, 3, 4], 'temp{0}')`, it will return `['temp1', 'temp2', 'temp3', 'temp4']`, as expected.
