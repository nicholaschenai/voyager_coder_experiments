Write a function to calculate whether the matrix is a magic square.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/129 [generation text] Answer: To determine if a given matrix is a magic square in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Definition of a Magic Square**: A magic square is a square matrix in which the sum of every row, column, and both main diagonals are the same.

2. **Calculate the Magic Constant**: For an `n x n` magic square, the magic constant (the sum that each row, column, and diagonal should equal) can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Magic Constant} = \frac{n(n^2 + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where `n` is the number of rows (or columns) in the square.

3. **Check Dimensions**: Ensure that the input is a square matrix (i.e., the number of rows equals the number of columns).

4. **Sum Rows and Columns**: Iterate through each row and column of the matrix to calculate their sums. Store these sums for comparison.

5. **Sum Diagonals**: Calculate the sums of the two main diagonals (from top-left to bottom-right and from top-right to bottom-left).

6. **Comparison**: Compare all the calculated sums (rows, columns, and diagonals) to the magic constant. If they all match, the matrix is a magic square; otherwise, it is not.

7. **Return Result**: The function should return `True` if the matrix is a magic square and `False` otherwise.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def magic_square_test(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    magic_constant = n * (n**2 + 1) // 2
    
    # Check sums of rows
    for row in matrix:
        if sum(row) != magic_constant:
            return False
    
    # Check sums of columns
    for col in range(n):
        if sum(matrix[row][col] for row in range(n)) != magic_constant:
            return False
    
    # Check sums of diagonals
    if sum(matrix[i][i] for i in range(n)) != magic_constant:
        return False
    if sum(matrix[i][n - 1 - i] for i in range(n)) != magic_constant:
        return False
    
    return True
```

This function implements the steps outlined above to determine if the input matrix is a magic square.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
