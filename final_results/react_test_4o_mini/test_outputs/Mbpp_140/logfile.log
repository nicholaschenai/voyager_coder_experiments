Write a function to flatten the list of lists into a single set of numbers.

"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/140 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of flattening a list of lists into a single set of numbers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function named `extract_singly` that takes a list of tuples (or lists) as an argument.

2. **Initialize a Set**: Inside the function, initialize an empty set. A set is used here because it automatically handles duplicates, ensuring that each number appears only once in the final output.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to iterate through each tuple (or list) in the input list.

4. **Add Elements to the Set**: For each tuple, iterate through its elements and add each element to the set. This can be done using the `update()` method of the set, which allows you to add multiple elements at once.

5. **Return the Set**: After processing all tuples, return the set containing the unique numbers.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def extract_singly(list_of_tuples):
    unique_numbers = set()  # Step 2: Initialize a set
    for tup in list_of_tuples:  # Step 3: Iterate through the list
        unique_numbers.update(tup)  # Step 4: Add elements to the set
    return unique_numbers  # Step 5: Return the set
```

This function will take a list of tuples, flatten it, and return a set of unique numbers, which can then be asserted against the expected output as shown in your example.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of flattening a list of lists into a single set of numbers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function named `extract_singly` that takes a list of tuples (or lists) as an argument.

2. **Initialize a Set**: Inside the function, initialize an empty set. A set is used here because it automatically handles duplicates, ensuring that each number appears only once in the final output.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to iterate through each tuple (or list) in the input list.

4. **Add Elements to the Set**: For each tuple, iterate through its elements and add each element to the set. This can be done using the `update()` method of the set, which allows you to add multiple elements at once.

5. **Return the Set**: After processing all tuples, return the set containing the unique numbers.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def extract_singly(list_of_tuples):
    unique_numbers = set()  # Step 2: Initialize a set
    for tup in list_of_tuples:  # Step 3: Iterate through the list
        unique_numbers.update(tup)  # Step 4: Add elements to the set
    return unique_numbers  # Step 5: Return the set
```

This function will take a list of tuples, flatten it, and return a set of unique numbers, which can then be asserted against the expected output as shown in your example.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/140 [generation text] Explain: The plan provided in the context is mostly correct and outlines the necessary steps to flatten a list of tuples into a set of unique numbers. The function name and input/output types specified in the assertion are clear, and the approach of using a set to handle duplicates is appropriate.

Plan:
1) Define the function `extract_singly` that takes a single argument, `list_of_tuples`, which is expected to be a list of tuples.
2) Initialize an empty set to store unique numbers.
3) Iterate through each tuple in the input list.
4) For each tuple, use the `update()` method of the set to add its elements, ensuring that duplicates are automatically handled.
5) Return the set of unique numbers after processing all tuples.

Code:
```python
def extract_singly(list_of_tuples):
    unique_numbers = set()  # Step 2: Initialize a set
    for tup in list_of_tuples:  # Step 3: Iterate through the list
