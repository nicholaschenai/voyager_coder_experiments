INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/89 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to find the closest smaller number than n.
assert closest_num(11) == 10
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/89 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the closest smaller number than a given number `n` in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function named `closest_num` that takes one parameter, `n`.

2. **Check for Valid Input**: Inside the function, you may want to check if `n` is greater than 0, as there are no smaller numbers than 0 in the context of positive integers.

3. **Calculate the Closest Smaller Number**: The closest smaller number than `n` can be simply calculated as `n - 1`.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the calculated number.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def closest_num(n):
    if n > 0:
        return n - 1
    else:
        return None  # or raise an exception, depending on your requirements
```

With this function, calling `closest_num(11)` will return `10`, which is the expected output. You can also include assertions to test the function, as shown in your example.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/89 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided in the context is mostly correct, but it lacks clarity on handling edge cases, such as when `n` is less than or equal to 0. The function should ideally return a specific value or raise an exception in such cases. However, since the task does not specify behavior for non-positive integers, we will assume that the function should only handle positive integers.

Plan:
1) Define the function `closest_num` that takes an integer `n` as input.
2) Check if `n` is greater than 0. If it is, return `n - 1` as the closest smaller number.
3) If `n` is less than or equal to 0, return `None` (or handle it as per the requirements, but we will return `None` for this implementation).

Code:
```python
def closest_num(n: int) -> int:
    if n > 0:
        return n - 1
    else:
        return None  # Handling for non-positive integers
