"""
Write a function to find perfect squares between two given numbers.
assert perfect_squares(1,30)==[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/589 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding perfect squares between two given numbers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `perfect_squares` that takes two parameters, representing the lower and upper bounds of the range.

2. **Initialize a List**: Inside the function, initialize an empty list to store the perfect squares.

3. **Iterate Through the Range**: Use a loop to iterate through the numbers from the lower bound to the upper bound (inclusive).

4. **Check for Perfect Squares**: For each number in the range, check if it is a perfect square. A number is a perfect square if the square of its integer square root equals the number itself.

5. **Append to the List**: If a number is found to be a perfect square, append it to the list.

6. **Return the List**: After the loop, return the list of perfect squares.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def perfect_squares(lower, upper):
    squares = []
    for num in range(lower, upper + 1):
        if int(num**0.5) ** 2 == num:  # Check if num is a perfect square
            squares.append(num)
    return squares
```

This function can then be tested with the provided assertion to ensure it works correctly.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

Answer: To accomplish the task of finding perfect squares between two given numbers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `perfect_squares` that takes two parameters, representing the lower and upper bounds of the range.

2. **Initialize a List**: Inside the function, initialize an empty list to store the perfect squares.

3. **Iterate Through the Range**: Use a loop to iterate through the numbers from the lower bound to the upper bound (inclusive).

4. **Check for Perfect Squares**: For each number in the range, check if it is a perfect square. A number is a perfect square if the square of its integer square root equals the number itself.

5. **Append to the List**: If a number is found to be a perfect square, append it to the list.

6. **Return the List**: After the loop, return the list of perfect squares.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def perfect_squares(lower, upper):
    squares = []
    for num in range(lower, upper + 1):
        if int(num**0.5) ** 2 == num:  # Check if num is a perfect square
            squares.append(num)
    return squares
```

This function can then be tested with the provided assertion to ensure it works correctly.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/589 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct and outlines the necessary steps to find perfect squares between two given numbers. The code snippet in the plan is also appropriate for the task. There are no missing steps, and the logic for checking perfect squares is sound.

Plan:
1) Define the function `perfect_squares` that takes two parameters: `lower` and `upper`.
2) Initialize an empty list called `squares` to store the perfect squares found in the specified range.
3) Use a for loop to iterate through the numbers from `lower` to `upper` (inclusive).
4) For each number, check if it is a perfect square by comparing the square of its integer square root to the number itself.
5) If a number is a perfect square, append it to the `squares` list.
6) Return the `squares` list after the loop completes.

Code:
```python
def perfect_squares(lower: int, upper: int) -> list:
    squares = []
    for num in range(lower, upper + 1):
        if int(num**0.5) ** 2 == num:  # Check if num is a perfect square
