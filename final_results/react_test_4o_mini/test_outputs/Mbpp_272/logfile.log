"""
Write a function that takes in a list of tuples and returns a list containing the rear element of each tuple.
assert rear_extract([(1, 'Rash', 21), (2, 'Varsha', 20), (3, 'Kil', 19)]) == [21, 20, 19]
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/272 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of extracting the rear element from each tuple in a list of tuples in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a list of tuples as its parameter.

2. **Iterate Over the List**: Use a loop (like a list comprehension or a for loop) to iterate over each tuple in the provided list.

3. **Access the Rear Element**: For each tuple, access the last element. In Python, you can do this by using indexing. The last element of a tuple can be accessed using the index `-1`.

4. **Collect the Results**: Store the extracted rear elements in a new list.

5. **Return the New List**: Finally, return the list containing all the rear elements.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def rear_extract(tuples_list):
    return [t[-1] for t in tuples_list]  # List comprehension to extract the last element of each tuple
```

In this function, `t[-1]` accesses the last element of each tuple `t`, and the list comprehension collects these elements into a new list, which is then returned. 

You can then use the `assert` statement to verify that the function works as expected with the provided example.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/272 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct and outlines the necessary steps to achieve the task. The function should iterate over a list of tuples, extract the last element from each tuple, and return a new list containing these elements. The proposed implementation using list comprehension is efficient and concise.

Plan:
1) Define the function `rear_extract` that takes a list of tuples as an argument.
2) Use a list comprehension to iterate over each tuple in the list.
3) For each tuple, access the last element using the index `-1`.
4) Return the new list containing all the extracted rear elements.
