"""
Write a python function to split a list at the nth eelment and add the first part to the end.

"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/586 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of splitting a list at the nth element and adding the first part to the end, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `split_Arr` that takes two parameters: the list to be split and the index `n`.

2. **Slice the List**: Use list slicing to divide the list into two parts:
   - The first part will be from the start of the list up to (but not including) the nth element.
   - The second part will be from the nth element to the end of the list.

3. **Concatenate the Parts**: Combine the second part of the list with the first part. This can be done by using the `+` operator to concatenate the two slices.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the newly formed list.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def split_Arr(arr, n):
    # Slice the list into two parts
    first_part = arr[:n]  # Elements before the nth element
    second_part = arr[n:]  # Elements from the nth element to the end
    
    # Concatenate the second part with the first part
    result = second_part + first_part
    
    return result
```

With this function, calling `split_Arr([12,10,5,6,52,36], 2)` will yield `[5,6,52,36,12,10]`, as expected.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of splitting a list at the nth element and adding the first part to the end, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `split_Arr` that takes two parameters: the list to be split and the index `n`.

2. **Slice the List**: Use list slicing to divide the list into two parts:
   - The first part will be from the start of the list up to (but not including) the nth element.
   - The second part will be from the nth element to the end of the list.

3. **Concatenate the Parts**: Combine the second part of the list with the first part. This can be done by using the `+` operator to concatenate the two slices.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the newly formed list.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def split_Arr(arr, n):
    # Slice the list into two parts
    first_part = arr[:n]  # Elements before the nth element
    second_part = arr[n:]  # Elements from the nth element to the end
    
    # Concatenate the second part with the first part
    result = second_part + first_part
    
    return result
```

With this function, calling `split_Arr([12,10,5,6,52,36], 2)` will yield `[5,6,52,36,12,10]`, as expected.
