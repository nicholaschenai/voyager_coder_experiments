INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/618 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to divide two lists element wise.
assert div_list([4,5,6],[1, 2, 3])==[4.0,2.5,2.0]
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/618 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of dividing two lists element-wise in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `div_list` that takes two lists as parameters.

2. **Check Lengths**: Ensure that both lists are of the same length. If they are not, you might want to raise an error or handle it appropriately.

3. **Element-wise Division**: Use a loop or a list comprehension to iterate through the elements of both lists simultaneously. For each pair of elements (one from each list), perform the division.

4. **Store Results**: Collect the results of the division in a new list.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the new list containing the results of the element-wise division.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def div_list(list1, list2):
    if len(list1) != len(list2):
        raise ValueError("Lists must be of the same length")
    return [a / b for a, b in zip(list1, list2)]
```

In this implementation:
- We use `zip` to pair elements from both lists.
- A list comprehension is used to create a new list with the results of the division.
- The function raises a `ValueError` if the lists are not of the same length, ensuring that the operation is valid.

You can then use the `assert` statement to verify that the function works as expected.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of dividing two lists element-wise in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `div_list` that takes two lists as parameters.

2. **Check Lengths**: Ensure that both lists are of the same length. If they are not, you might want to raise an error or handle it appropriately.

3. **Element-wise Division**: Use a loop or a list comprehension to iterate through the elements of both lists simultaneously. For each pair of elements (one from each list), perform the division.

4. **Store Results**: Collect the results of the division in a new list.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the new list containing the results of the element-wise division.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def div_list(list1, list2):
    if len(list1) != len(list2):
        raise ValueError("Lists must be of the same length")
    return [a / b for a, b in zip(list1, list2)]
```

In this implementation:
- We use `zip` to pair elements from both lists.
- A list comprehension is used to create a new list with the results of the division.
- The function raises a `ValueError` if the lists are not of the same length, ensuring that the operation is valid.

You can then use the `assert` statement to verify that the function works as expected.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/618 [generation text] Explain: The provided plan and code implementation are correct and complete. The function `div_list` is defined to take two lists, checks if they are of the same length, and performs element-wise division using a list comprehension. The use of `zip` to pair elements from both lists is appropriate, and raising a `ValueError` for mismatched lengths is a good practice.

Plan:
1) Define the function `div_list` that takes two lists as parameters.
2) Check if the lengths of both lists are equal; if not, raise a `ValueError`.
3) Use a list comprehension with `zip` to iterate through both lists and perform element-wise division.
4) Return the resulting list containing the division results.

Code:
```python
def div_list(list1, list2):
