INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/7 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to find all words which are at least 4 characters long in a string.
assert set(find_char_long('Please move back to stream')) == set(['Please', 'move', 'back', 'stream'])
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/7 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding all words that are at least 4 characters long in a given string in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `find_char_long` that takes a string as an argument.

2. **Split the String**: Use the `split()` method to break the string into individual words. This method will separate the string at whitespace and return a list of words.

3. **Filter Words**: Iterate through the list of words and check the length of each word using the `len()` function. You can use a list comprehension or a loop to collect words that have a length of 4 or more.

4. **Return Unique Words**: Since the assertion checks for a set of words, you can convert the list of filtered words into a set to ensure uniqueness before returning it.

5. **Testing**: Use the provided assertion to test if your function works correctly.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def find_char_long(input_string):
    # Step 2: Split the string into words
    words = input_string.split()
    
    # Step 3: Filter words that are at least 4 characters long
    long_words = [word for word in words if len(word) >= 4]
    
    # Step 4: Return unique words as a set
    return set(long_words)
```

This function will successfully find and return all unique words that are at least 4 characters long from the input string.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding all words that are at least 4 characters long in a given string in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `find_char_long` that takes a string as an argument.

2. **Split the String**: Use the `split()` method to break the string into individual words. This method will separate the string at whitespace and return a list of words.

3. **Filter Words**: Iterate through the list of words and check the length of each word using the `len()` function. You can use a list comprehension or a loop to collect words that have a length of 4 or more.

4. **Return Unique Words**: Since the assertion checks for a set of words, you can convert the list of filtered words into a set to ensure uniqueness before returning it.

5. **Testing**: Use the provided assertion to test if your function works correctly.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def find_char_long(input_string):
    # Step 2: Split the string into words
    words = input_string.split()
    
    # Step 3: Filter words that are at least 4 characters long
    long_words = [word for word in words if len(word) >= 4]
    
    # Step 4: Return unique words as a set
    return set(long_words)
```

This function will successfully find and return all unique words that are at least 4 characters long from the input string.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/7 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct and outlines the necessary steps to achieve the task. The function `find_char_long` is defined correctly, and the logic for splitting the string, filtering words based on their length, and returning a set of unique words is sound. There are no missing steps, and the code should complete the task as specified.

Plan:
1) Define the function `find_char_long` that takes a string as input.
2) Split the input string into a list of words using the `split()` method.
3) Use a list comprehension to filter out words that are at least 4 characters long.
4) Convert the list of filtered words into a set to ensure uniqueness.
5) Return the set of unique words.

Code:
```python
def find_char_long(input_string: str) -> set:
    # Step 2: Split the string into words
    words = input_string.split()
    
    # Step 3: Filter words that are at least 4 characters long
    long_words = [word for word in words if len(word) >= 4]
