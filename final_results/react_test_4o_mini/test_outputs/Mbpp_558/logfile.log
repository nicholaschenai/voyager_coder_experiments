"""
Write a python function to find the sum of the per-digit difference between two integers.
assert digit_distance_nums(1,2) == 1
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/558 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the sum of the per-digit difference between two integers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Convert the Integers to Strings**: This allows you to easily access each digit of the integers.

2. **Align the Digits**: Since the two integers may have different lengths, you should pad the shorter one with leading zeros. This ensures that you can compare corresponding digits directly.

3. **Calculate the Per-Digit Difference**: Iterate through the digits of both integers, convert them back to integers, and compute the absolute difference for each pair of corresponding digits.

4. **Sum the Differences**: Keep a running total of the differences as you iterate through the digits.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the total sum of the differences.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def digit_distance_nums(num1, num2):
    # Step 1: Convert numbers to strings
    str_num1 = str(num1)
    str_num2 = str(num2)
    
    # Step 2: Pad the shorter string with leading zeros
    max_length = max(len(str_num1), len(str_num2))
    str_num1 = str_num1.zfill(max_length)
    str_num2 = str_num2.zfill(max_length)
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the per-digit difference
    total_difference = 0
    for digit1, digit2 in zip(str_num1, str_num2):
        total_difference += abs(int(digit1) - int(digit2))
    
    # Step 4: Return the result
    return total_difference
```

This function will correctly compute the sum of the per-digit differences for any two integers. The assertion `assert digit_distance_nums(1, 2) == 1` will pass, as the difference between the digits '1' and '2' is indeed 1.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

This function will correctly compute the sum of the per-digit differences for any two integers. The assertion `assert digit_distance_nums(1, 2) == 1` will pass, as the difference between the digits '1' and '2' is indeed 1.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/558 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided in the context is mostly correct and outlines the necessary steps to achieve the task. The function needs to convert the integers to strings, pad them to the same length, compute the absolute differences for each digit, and sum these differences.

Plan:
1) Convert the two integers to strings to facilitate digit-wise comparison.
2) Determine the maximum length of the two strings and pad the shorter one with leading zeros to ensure both strings have the same length.
3) Initialize a variable to keep track of the total difference.
4) Iterate through the digits of both strings, calculate the absolute difference for each pair of corresponding digits, and accumulate this difference.
5) Return the total sum of the differences.
