INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/120 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to find the maximum absolute product between numbers in pairs of tuples within a given list.
assert max_product_tuple([(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 8), (4, 9)] )==36
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/120 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the maximum absolute product between numbers in pairs of tuples within a given list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `max_product_tuple` that takes a list of tuples as an argument.

2. **Initialize a Variable**: Inside the function, initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum product found. You can start with a value of zero or negative infinity.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to iterate through each tuple in the list.

4. **Calculate the Product**: For each tuple, calculate the product of the two numbers. Since you are interested in the absolute product, you can use the `abs()` function to ensure the product is non-negative.

5. **Update the Maximum Product**: Compare the calculated product with the current maximum product. If the calculated product is greater, update the maximum product variable.

6. **Return the Result**: After iterating through all the tuples, return the maximum product found.

Here is a conceptual outline of the code:

```python
def max_product_tuple(tuples_list):
    max_product = 0  # or float('-inf') for a more general case
    for a, b in tuples_list:
        product = abs(a * b)  # Calculate the absolute product
        if product > max_product:
            max_product = product  # Update max product if current is greater
    return max_product  # Return the maximum product found
```

This function will correctly compute the maximum absolute product for the given list of tuples. The assertion provided in the question can be used to test the function after implementation.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the maximum absolute product between numbers in pairs of tuples within a given list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `max_product_tuple` that takes a list of tuples as an argument.

2. **Initialize a Variable**: Inside the function, initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum product found. You can start with a value of zero or negative infinity.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to iterate through each tuple in the list.

4. **Calculate the Product**: For each tuple, calculate the product of the two numbers. Since you are interested in the absolute product, you can use the `abs()` function to ensure the product is non-negative.

5. **Update the Maximum Product**: Compare the calculated product with the current maximum product. If the calculated product is greater, update the maximum product variable.

6. **Return the Result**: After iterating through all the tuples, return the maximum product found.

Here is a conceptual outline of the code:

```python
def max_product_tuple(tuples_list):
    max_product = 0  # or float('-inf') for a more general case
    for a, b in tuples_list:
        product = abs(a * b)  # Calculate the absolute product
        if product > max_product:
            max_product = product  # Update max product if current is greater
    return max_product  # Return the maximum product found
```

This function will correctly compute the maximum absolute product for the given list of tuples. The assertion provided in the question can be used to test the function after implementation.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/120 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct and outlines the necessary steps to implement the function. The code structure is clear, and the logic for calculating the maximum absolute product is sound. However, the initial value of `max_product` should be set to a very small number (like negative infinity) to handle cases where all products might be negative. 

Plan:
1) Define the function `max_product_tuple` that takes a list of tuples as input.
2) Initialize a variable `max_product` to negative infinity to ensure it can accommodate all possible products.
3) Iterate through each tuple in the list.
4) For each tuple, calculate the absolute product of the two numbers.
5) Compare the calculated product with `max_product` and update `max_product` if the current product is greater.
6) Return the maximum product found after iterating through all tuples.

Code:
```python
def max_product_tuple(tuples_list):
    max_product = float('-inf')  # Initialize to negative infinity
    for a, b in tuples_list:
        product = abs(a * b)  # Calculate the absolute product
