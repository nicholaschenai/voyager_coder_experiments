"""
Write a function to find frequency of each element in a flattened list of lists, returned in a dictionary.
assert frequency_lists([[1, 2, 3, 2], [4, 5, 6, 2], [7, 8, 9, 5]])=={1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 2, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1}
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/97 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the frequency of each element in a flattened list of lists in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Flatten the List of Lists**: You need to combine all the inner lists into a single list. This can be done using a list comprehension or the `itertools.chain` method.

2. **Count Frequencies**: Once you have a single flattened list, you can count the occurrences of each element. This can be efficiently done using a dictionary where the keys are the elements and the values are their respective counts.

3. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the dictionary containing the frequency of each element.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def frequency_lists(nested_list):
    # Step 1: Flatten the list of lists
    flattened_list = [item for sublist in nested_list for item in sublist]
    
    # Step 2: Count frequencies
    frequency_dict = {}
    for item in flattened_list:
        if item in frequency_dict:
            frequency_dict[item] += 1
        else:
            frequency_dict[item] = 1
            
    # Step 3: Return the frequency dictionary
    return frequency_dict
```

In this function:
- The list comprehension `[item for sublist in nested_list for item in sublist]` flattens the nested list.
- The loop iterates through each item in the flattened list, updating the count in the `frequency_dict`.

You can then use the `assert` statement to verify that the function works as expected with the provided test case.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/97 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is correct and outlines the necessary steps to achieve the task. The function needs to flatten the list of lists, count the frequency of each element, and return the result as a dictionary. The code provided in the plan is also well-structured and follows the requirements.

Plan:
1) Define the function `frequency_lists` that takes a nested list as input.
2) Flatten the nested list into a single list using a list comprehension.
3) Create an empty dictionary to store the frequency of each element.
4) Iterate through the flattened list and update the frequency count in the dictionary.
5) Return the frequency dictionary.

Code:
