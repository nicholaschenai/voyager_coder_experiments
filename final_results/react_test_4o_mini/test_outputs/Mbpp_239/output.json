    "reasoning": "The implementation failed the test case because it does not correctly count the number of valid sequences. The recursive call to `get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n - 1)` is made without considering the current value of `x` as the starting point for the next sequence. As a result, it counts sequences starting from all integers from 1 to m for each recursive call, leading to an incorrect total count.",
    "success": false,
    "critique": "To fix the implementation, you need to ensure that the recursive call is made with the correct starting point for the next element in the sequence. Specifically, after determining the next starting point as `next_start`, you should iterate through the valid range of integers starting from `next_start` to `m` and count the sequences recursively. This means modifying the loop to start from `next_start` and go up to `m`, and then call the function with `n - 1`."
