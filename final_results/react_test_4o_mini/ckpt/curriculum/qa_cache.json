This can be done by converting the number to a string and comparing it to its reverse.\n\n4. **Loop Until Found**: Use a loop to continuously check each subsequent integer (incrementing by 1 each time) until you find a number that is a palindrome.\n\n5. **Return the Result**: Once you find the next palindrome, return it as the result of the function.\n\nHere is a conceptual outline of the function:\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(n):\n    return str(n) == str(n)[::-1]\n\ndef next_smallest_palindrome(n):\n    n += 1  # Start checking from the next integer\n    while not is_palindrome(n):\n        n += 1  # Increment until a palindrome is found\n    return n\n```\n\nIn this function:\n- `is_palindrome` checks if a number is a palindrome.\n- `next_smallest_palindrome` finds the next palindrome by incrementing the number and checking each one until it finds a palindrome.\n\nThis approach is straightforward and works well for reasonably sized integers.",

The rightmost bit is the least significant bit (LSB), and the leftmost bit is the most significant bit (MSB).\n\n2. **Identify Even Bits**: In binary representation, even bits are those at positions 0, 2, 4, etc. For example, in the binary number `1010` (which is `10` in decimal), the bits are indexed as follows:\n   - Bit 3: 1\n   - Bit 2: 0\n   - Bit 1: 1\n   - Bit 0: 0\n\n   Here, bits 0 and 2 are even bits.\n\n3. **Create a Mask**: To set the even bits, you can create a mask that has 1s in all even positions. For example, if you want to set the even bits for a 4-bit number, the mask would be `0101` in binary (which is `5` in decimal).\n\n4. **Use Bitwise OR Operation**: To set the even bits of the given number, you can use the bitwise OR operation (`|`) between the original number and the mask. This operation will set the bits in the original number to 1 wherever the mask has 1s.\n\n5. **Implement the Function**: You can implement the function by defining it, creating the mask, and applying the bitwise OR operation.\n\nHere is a conceptual outline of the function:\n\n```python\ndef even_bit_set_number(n):\n    # Create a mask for even bits\n    mask = 0b0101010101010101  # This mask sets all even bits for a 16-bit number\n    # Set the even bits using bitwise OR\n    return n | mask\n```\n\n6. **Testing the Function**: Finally, you can test the function with the provided assertion to ensure it behaves as expected.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively set all even bits of a given number in Python.",

This can be checked using the expression `number % 2 == 0`.\n\n3. **Return the Result**: The function should return `True` if the number is even and `False` if it is not.\n\n4. **Use Assertions for Testing**: You can use an assertion to test the function.

A path is defined as a specific sequence of cells that starts from the top-left cell move only right or down and ends on bottom right cell. We want to find a path with the maximum average over all existing paths. Average is computed as total cost divided by the number of cells visited in the path.\nassert maxAverageOfPath([[1, 2, 3], [6, 5, 4], [7, 3, 9]]) == 5.2\n\"\"\"\n": "Answer: To solve the problem of finding the path with the maximum average cost in a square matrix, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Here\u2019s a conceptual breakdown of how to accomplish this task:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find a path from the top-left corner of the matrix to the bottom-right corner, moving only right or down. The goal is to maximize the average cost of the cells visited along this path.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We can create a 2D list (or table) `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will store the maximum total cost to reach cell `(i, j)` and the number of cells visited to reach that cell. This will help us calculate the average later.\n\n3. **Initialization**: Start by initializing `dp[0][0]` with the cost of the top-left cell and set the number of cells visited to 1.\n\n4. **Filling the DP Table**:\n   - Iterate through each cell in the matrix.\n   - For each cell `(i, j)`, check the cells from which it can be reached: `(i-1, j)` (from above) and `(i, j-1)` (from the left).\n   - Update `dp[i][j]` by considering the maximum total cost from the reachable cells and adding the current cell's cost. Also, update the count of cells visited.\n\n5. **Calculating the Maximum Average**: Once the `dp` table is filled, the maximum average can be calculated by iterating through the last cell `dp[N-1][N-1]`, which contains the total cost and the number of cells visited to reach the bottom-right corner. The average is computed as `total_cost / number_of_cells`.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the maximum average found.\n\nHere\u2019s a high-level pseudocode to illustrate the above steps:\n\n```python\ndef maxAverageOfPath(matrix):\n    N = len(matrix)\n    dp = [[(0, 0) for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]  # (total_cost, num_cells)\n    \n    dp[0][0] = (matrix[0][0], 1)  # Initialize the starting point\n    \n    for i in range(N):\n        for j in range(N):\n            if i == 0 and j == 0:\n                continue  # Skip the starting cell\n            max_cost, num_cells = 0, 0\n            \n            if i > 0:  # From above\n                max_cost, num_cells = max(max_cost, dp[i-1][j][0]), dp[i-1][j][1]\n            if j > 0:  # From left\n                if dp[i][j-1][0] > max_cost:\n                    max_cost, num_cells = dp[i][j-1][0], dp[i][j-1][1]\n            \n            dp[i][j] = (max_cost + matrix[i][j], num_cells + 1)\n    \n    total_cost, num_cells = dp[N-1][N-1]\n    return total_cost / num_cells  # Calculate the average\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum average path cost while adhering to the movement constraints.",

For example, if the list is `[1, 2, 4, 5]` and the value is `6`, the correct insertion point is `4` because `6` would be placed at the end of the list.\n\n2. **Use Binary Search**: Since the list is sorted, you can efficiently find the insertion point using a binary search algorithm. This approach reduces the time complexity to O(log n), which is much faster than a linear search (O(n)).\n\n3. **Implement the Function**:\n   - Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the bounds of the search.\n   - While `left` is less than or equal to `right`, calculate the middle index.\n   - Compare the middle element with the target value:\n     - If the middle element is less than or equal to the target, move the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`.\n     - If the middle element is greater than the target, move the `right` pointer to `mid - 1`.\n   - When the loop ends, `left` will be the index where the target can be inserted.\n\n4. **Return the Result**: The function should return the `left` index, which represents the right insertion point.\n\nHere is a simple implementation of the above logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef right_insertion(sorted_list, value):\n    left, right = 0, len(sorted_list)\n    \n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if sorted_list[mid] <= value:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid\n            \n    return left\n\n# Example usage\nassert right_insertion([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4\n```\n\nThis function will correctly find the right insertion point for any specified value in a sorted list.",
