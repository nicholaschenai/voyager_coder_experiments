[description for function: reverse_strings]
This function takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list containing those strings reversed. If the input list is empty, it returns an empty list. It iterates through each string in the input list, reversing each one using slicing. The reversed strings are collected in a new list. Finally, the function returns the list of reversed strings. This allows for easy manipulation of string data by reversing their order.
