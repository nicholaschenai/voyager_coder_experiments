[description for function: increment_list_elements]
This function takes a list of numbers as input and creates a new list by adding one to each element of the input list. It initializes an empty list to store the incremented values. It then iterates through each number in the input list, increments it by one, and appends the result to the new list. Finally, the function returns the new list containing all the incremented values. The output list will have the same length as the input list, with each element increased by one. This function effectively transforms the input list by applying a simple arithmetic operation to each of its elements.
