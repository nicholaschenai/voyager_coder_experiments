[description for function: unique_elements]
This function takes a list as input and converts it into a set to eliminate any duplicate elements. It then transforms the set back into a list, resulting in a collection of unique elements. The order of elements may not be preserved since sets do not maintain order. Finally, the function returns this list of unique elements. This is useful for situations where only distinct values are needed from a given list. Overall, it provides a simple way to filter out duplicates from a list.
