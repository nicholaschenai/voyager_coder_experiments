[description for function: symmetric_difference]
This function takes two lists as input and converts them into sets to eliminate any duplicate values. It then calculates the symmetric difference between the two sets, which includes elements that are in either of the sets but not in both. Finally, it returns the resulting set containing these unique elements. The use of sets ensures that the operation is efficient and straightforward. The output will be a set of items that are exclusive to each input list. Overall, it provides a clear way to identify differences between two collections of items.
