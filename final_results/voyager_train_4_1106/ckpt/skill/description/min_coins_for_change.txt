[description for function: min_coins_for_change]
This function calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make a specified target amount using given denominations. It initializes a dynamic programming array to store the minimum coins required for each amount up to the target. For each coin denomination, it updates the array by checking if using the coin results in fewer coins for each possible amount. If the target amount can be formed, it returns the minimum number of coins; otherwise, it returns -1 to indicate that the target cannot be achieved with the given denominations. The approach efficiently determines the solution using a bottom-up dynamic programming technique.
