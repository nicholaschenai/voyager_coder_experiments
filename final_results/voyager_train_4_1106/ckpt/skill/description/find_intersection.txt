[description for function: find_intersection]
This function takes two lists as input and converts them into sets to eliminate any duplicate values. It then computes the intersection of these two sets, which contains only the elements that are present in both sets. The resulting intersection is converted back into a list format. Finally, the function returns this list of intersecting elements. This approach efficiently identifies common elements between the two input lists. The output will only include unique values that appear in both lists.
