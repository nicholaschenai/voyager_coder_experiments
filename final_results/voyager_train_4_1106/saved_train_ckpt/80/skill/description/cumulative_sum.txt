[description for function: cumulative_sum]
This function takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the cumulative sum of the elements. It initializes a variable to keep track of the running total and an empty list to store the cumulative sums. As it iterates through each number in the input list, it adds the current number to the running total and appends this total to the cumulative list. Finally, it returns the list containing the cumulative sums. The output reflects the progressive addition of the input numbers. This allows users to see how the sum evolves as each element is processed.
