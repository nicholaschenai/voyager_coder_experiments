[description for function: is_balanced]
This function checks if a string containing various types of brackets is balanced. It uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets and matches them with their corresponding closing brackets. As it iterates through the string, it pushes opening brackets onto the stack and pops them when a matching closing bracket is found. If a closing bracket does not match the most recent opening bracket or if there are unmatched opening brackets left in the stack at the end, it returns false. If all brackets are matched correctly, it returns true. The function effectively ensures that every opening bracket has a corresponding and correctly ordered closing bracket.
