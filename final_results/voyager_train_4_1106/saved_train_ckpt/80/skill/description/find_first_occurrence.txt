[description for function: find_first_occurrence]
This function searches for the first occurrence of a specified target value in a sorted list using a binary search algorithm. It initializes two pointers to represent the current search range and a variable to store the result index. The function iteratively narrows down the search range by comparing the middle element of the current range with the target. If the middle element matches the target, it updates the result and continues searching in the left half to find the first occurrence. If the middle element is less than the target, it adjusts the left pointer to search the right half, and if it's greater, it adjusts the right pointer to search the left half. Finally, it returns the index of the first occurrence or -1 if the target is not found.
