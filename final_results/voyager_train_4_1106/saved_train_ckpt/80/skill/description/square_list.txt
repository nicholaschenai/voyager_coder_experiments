[description for function: square_list]
This function takes a list of numbers as input and creates a new list containing the squares of each number from the input list. It initializes an empty list to store the squared values. Then, it iterates through each number in the input list, calculates its square, and appends the result to the new list. Finally, the function returns the list of squared numbers. The output list will have the same length as the input list, with each element being the square of the corresponding input element. This function effectively transforms the input list by applying a mathematical operation to each of its elements.
