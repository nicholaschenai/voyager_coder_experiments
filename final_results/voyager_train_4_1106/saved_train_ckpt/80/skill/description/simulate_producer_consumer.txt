[description for function: simulate_producer_consumer]
This function simulates a producer-consumer scenario by taking a list of items as input and adding them to a queue. It then processes each item in the queue by removing it from the front and printing it. The function keeps track of the number of items consumed during this process. Once all items have been processed, it returns the total count of consumed items. The function effectively demonstrates a simple queue operation where items are produced and consumed sequentially.
