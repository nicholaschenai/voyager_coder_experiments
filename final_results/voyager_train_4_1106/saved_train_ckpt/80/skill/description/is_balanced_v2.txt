[description for function: is_balanced]
This function checks if a string containing various types of brackets (parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces) is balanced, meaning that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets encountered as it iterates through the string. When a closing bracket is found, it checks if it matches the most recent opening bracket on the stack. If there is a mismatch or if a closing bracket appears without a corresponding opening bracket, the function returns False. At the end of the iteration, if the stack is empty, it indicates that all brackets were properly closed, and the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. This ensures that the brackets are not only matched but also properly nested.
