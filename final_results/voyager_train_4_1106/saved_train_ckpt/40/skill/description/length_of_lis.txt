[description for function: length_of_lis]
This function calculates the length of the longest increasing subsequence in a given list of numbers. It initializes a dynamic programming array to keep track of the longest subsequence lengths at each index. The function iterates through the list, comparing each element with the previous ones to update the lengths based on the increasing condition. Finally, it returns the maximum value from the dynamic programming array, which represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence. If the input list is empty, it returns 0. Overall, it efficiently determines the desired length using a nested loop approach.
