[description for function: find_smallest_missing_positive]
This function identifies the smallest missing positive integer from a list of numbers. It first filters the input list to retain only positive integers and stores them in a set for efficient lookup. Then, it initializes a counter starting from 1 and enters an infinite loop. In each iteration, it checks if the current counter value is absent from the set of positive numbers. If it finds a missing integer, it returns that value. The process continues until the smallest missing positive integer is found.
