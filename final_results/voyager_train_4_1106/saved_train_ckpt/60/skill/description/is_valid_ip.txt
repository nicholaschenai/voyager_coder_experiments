[description for function: is_valid_ip]
This function checks whether a given string is a valid IPv4 address. It splits the input string into four octets and verifies that there are exactly four parts. Each octet is checked to ensure it is a digit and falls within the range of 0 to 255. Additionally, it ensures that octets do not have leading zeros unless they are exactly "0". If all conditions are met, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
