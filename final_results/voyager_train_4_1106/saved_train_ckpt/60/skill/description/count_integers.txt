[description for function: count_integers]
This function takes a list of integers as input and counts the occurrences of each integer in the list. It initializes an empty dictionary to store the counts. As it iterates through the list, it updates the count for each integer, either by incrementing the existing count or initializing it to one if the integer is encountered for the first time. Finally, it returns the dictionary containing the integers and their corresponding counts. This allows for a quick overview of how many times each integer appears in the input list. The function effectively provides a frequency distribution of the integers.
