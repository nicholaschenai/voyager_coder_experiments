    "critique": "The implementation appears to be correct based on the provided unit tests. However, it is important to ensure that the function is tested with a variety of graphs, including those with cycles and disconnected components, to confirm its robustness. Additionally, the function currently does not handle cases where the starting node is not in the graph, which could be improved by adding a check for the existence of the starting node in the graph before proceeding with the DFS."
