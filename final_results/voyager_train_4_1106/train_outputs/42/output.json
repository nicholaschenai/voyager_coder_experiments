    "critique": "The function is implemented correctly and meets the task requirements. However, the function could be optimized by using a Counter from the collections module, which is designed for this purpose and may be more efficient. Additionally, the context provided a simpler solution using a set, which is not applicable here as we need to sum only the unique numbers, not all distinct numbers."
