You are a helpful assistant that asks questions to help me decide the next immediate task to do for Python programming.
My ultimate goal is to solve as many diverse problems as possible and become the best programmer in the world.

I will give you the following information:
Completed tasks so far: ...
Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should ask at least 5 questions (but no more than 10 questions) to help me decide the next immediate task to do. Each question should be followed by the concept that the question is about.
2) Your question should be specific to a concept in Python programming.
  Bad example (the question is too general):
    Question: What is the best way to program in Python?
    Concept: unknown
  Good example:
    Question: How do you reverse a list?
    Concept: list
3) Your questions should be self-contained and not require any context.

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:

	Write a Python function that takes a string and returns the number of vowels in that string. The function should be case-insensitive.
	Write a Python function that takes two strings and returns True if one string is an anagram of the other, and False otherwise. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

	Write a Python function that takes an integer n and returns the nth number in the 'look-and-say' sequence. The 'look-and-say' sequence starts with '1' and each subsequent term is derived by describing the previous term. For example, the term after '1' is '11' (one 1), after '11' is '21' (two 1s), after '21' is '1211' (one 2, then one 1), and so on. The function should handle n being a positive integer greater than 0.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the elements that are prime numbers. The function should not modify the original list.

	Write a Python function that performs a breadth-first search (BFS) on a graph represented as an adjacency list. The function should take two arguments: the graph as a dictionary where keys are nodes and values are lists of adjacent nodes, and the starting node. The function should return a list of nodes in the order they are visited during the BFS traversal.
	Write a Python function that takes a string and returns True if all the characters in the string are unique, and False otherwise. The function should not use any additional data structures like sets or dictionaries.
	Write a Python function that takes a sorted list of integers and a target sum. The function should return a tuple of two integers from the list that add up to the target sum. If no such pair exists, return None. This task will utilize the two-pointer technique.
	Write a Python function that performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a graph represented as an adjacency list. The function should take two arguments: the graph as a dictionary where keys are nodes and values are lists of adjacent nodes, and the starting node. The function should return a list of nodes in the order they are visited during the DFS traversal.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the list of integers sorted in ascending order using the quicksort algorithm. The function should not modify the original list.
	Write a Python function that takes an integer `n` and returns the minimum number of squares whose sum equals `n`. This is a classic dynamic programming problem where you need to find the least number of perfect square numbers which sum to `n`. For example, given `n = 12`, the answer should be `3` because `12 = 4 + 4 + 4`.
	Write a Python function that takes a string and returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. The function should use the sliding window technique to efficiently solve the problem.
	Write a Python function that takes an integer `n` and returns the minimum number of steps to reduce it to zero. In one step, you can either decrement `n` by 1 or, if `n` is even, divide `n` by 2. The function should use dynamic programming to efficiently solve the problem.

	Write a Python function that takes a string and returns a dictionary where each key is a unique word in the string and the corresponding value is the number of times that word appears in the string. The function should ignore case and punctuation.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing the difference between each adjacent pair of numbers. The output list should have one less element than the input list.

	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the number of elements in the list that are greater than the sum of all previous elements in the list. For example, in the list [1, 2, 4, 1, 6], the elements 4 and 6 are greater than the sum of all previous elements (1+2 and 1+2+4+1, respectively).
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the longest subarray where the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the subarray is at most 1. The function should return the length of this subarray.

You are a helpful assistant that tells me the next immediate task (in the form of a function) to do for Python programming.

Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. As a rule of thumb, guide me through beginner problems, followed by interview level problems, followed by competitive programming problems. The latter 2 levels can involve concepts from data structures and algorithms.
2) Please be very specific about what skills I need to learn.
3) Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for problems which I have not solved yet. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) The task should involve writing a main Python function that at most use basic libraries (try not to import too many or too advanced modules)
7) Do not give tasks that require file operations (create, read, update, delete) or an internet connection.
8) I am only allowed to write Python functions, so do not require me to write other things (e.g. objects). 
9) Requiring me to write a function that takes in an object and uses object methods is still ok, but I cannot define the objects myself. You must provide the objects as input to my function in the assert statement.

Take note of these in your response:
1) Give an expected function name for the task.
2) Give a tuple of 3 assert statements that tests the function's correctness in the "test_tuple" field. This must strictly contain single-line assert statements only; any setup code for the test must be filled in the "test_setup_code" field.
3) The function name which you gave must be called in the assert statements. 

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}

}

INFO - [Task id] 77 [prompt] Question 1: How do you implement a binary search algorithm in Python?
Answer: To implement a binary search algorithm in Python, you can use either an iterative or a recursive approach. Below are examples of both methods.

### Iterative Approach

```python
def binary_search_iterative(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To avoid overflow
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Target found
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1  # Search in the right half
        else:
            right = mid - 1  # Search in the left half
            
    return -1  # Target not found
```

### Recursive Approach

```python
def binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, right):
    if left > right:
        return -1  # Target not found
    
    mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To avoid overflow
    
    if arr[mid] == target:
        return mid  # Target found
    elif arr[mid] < target:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, mid + 1, right)  # Search in the right half
    else:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, mid - 1)  # Search in the left half

# To use the recursive function, call it like this:
# result = binary_search_recursive(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
```

### Usage Example

```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
target = 5

# Using iterative approach
result_iterative = binary_search_iterative(arr, target)
print("Iterative result:", result_iterative)

# Using recursive approach
result_recursive = binary_search_recursive(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
print("Recursive result:", result_recursive)
```

Make sure the array is sorted before performing a binary search, as the algorithm assumes a sorted input.

Question 2: What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?
Answer: The main differences between a list and a tuple in Python are:

1. **Mutability**: Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their content (add, remove, or modify elements) after they are created. Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable, which means once a tuple is created, you cannot change its content.

2. **Syntax**: Lists are defined using square brackets `[]`, while tuples are defined using parentheses `()`.

3. **Performance**: Tuples can be slightly more memory-efficient and faster than lists for certain operations because of their immutability.

4. **Use Cases**: Lists are generally used for collections of items that may need to be modified, while tuples are often used for fixed collections of items, such as coordinates or records.

Example:
```python
# List
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)  # This is allowed

# Tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
# my_tuple.append(4)  # This would raise an AttributeError
```

In summary, use lists when you need a mutable sequence and tuples when you need an immutable sequence.

Question 3: How can you use list comprehensions to create a new list in Python?
Answer: You can use list comprehensions in Python to create a new list by applying an expression to each item in an existing iterable (like a list or a range) and optionally filtering items based on a condition. The syntax for a list comprehension is:

```python
new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition]
```

Here’s a simple example:

```python
# Create a list of squares of even numbers from 0 to 9
squares_of_evens = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
print(squares_of_evens)  # Output: [0, 4, 16, 36, 64]
```

In this example, `x**2` is the expression, `x` is the item from the iterable `range(10)`, and `if x % 2 == 0` is the condition that filters the items.

Question 4: What is the purpose of the 'with' statement in Python, and how is it used?
Answer: The 'with' statement in Python is used to wrap the execution of a block of code within methods defined by a context manager. The primary purpose of the 'with' statement is to ensure that resources are properly managed, such as opening and closing files, acquiring and releasing locks, or managing network connections.

When you use the 'with' statement, it simplifies exception handling by encapsulating common preparation and cleanup tasks in so-called context managers. This means that you don't have to explicitly release resources; the context manager takes care of it for you, even if an error occurs.

Here is a common example of using the 'with' statement to work with files:

```python
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

In this example, the file 'example.txt' is opened for reading. The 'with' statement ensures that the file is properly closed after the block of code is executed, regardless of whether an exception is raised within the block. This makes the code cleaner and less error-prone.

Question 5: How can you handle exceptions in Python using try and except?
Answer: In Python, you can handle exceptions using the `try` and `except` blocks. The code that might raise an exception is placed inside the `try` block, and the code that handles the exception is placed inside the `except` block. Here’s a basic example:

```python
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
    result = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
except ZeroDivisionError:
    # Code that runs if a ZeroDivisionError occurs
    print("You cannot divide by zero!")
except Exception as e:
    # Code that runs for any other exception
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
else:
    # Code that runs if no exception occurs
    print(f"The result is {result}")
finally:
    # Code that runs no matter what (optional)
    print("Execution completed.")
```

In this example:
- The `try` block contains code that may raise an exception.
- The `except` block catches specific exceptions (like `ZeroDivisionError`) and handles them.
- The `else` block runs if no exceptions were raised in the `try` block.
- The `finally` block runs regardless of whether an exception occurred or not, which is useful for cleanup actions.

The function should handle n being a positive integer greater than 0.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the elements that are prime numbers. The function should not modify the original list.

	Write a Python function that takes a string and returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. The function should use the sliding window technique to efficiently solve the problem.
	Write a Python function that takes an integer `n` and returns the minimum number of steps to reduce it to zero. In one step, you can either decrement `n` by 1 or, if `n` is even, divide `n` by 2. The function should use dynamic programming to efficiently solve the problem.

Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. As a rule of thumb, guide me through beginner problems, followed by interview level problems, followed by competitive programming problems. The latter 2 levels can involve concepts from data structures and algorithms.
2) Please be very specific about what skills I need to learn.
3) Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for problems which I have not solved yet. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) The task should involve writing a main Python function that at most use basic libraries (try not to import too many or too advanced modules)
7) Do not give tasks that require file operations (create, read, update, delete) or an internet connection.
8) I am only allowed to write Python functions, so do not require me to write other things (e.g. objects). 
9) Requiring me to write a function that takes in an object and uses object methods is still ok, but I cannot define the objects myself. You must provide the objects as input to my function in the assert statement.

Take note of these in your response:
1) Give an expected function name for the task.
2) Give a tuple of 3 assert statements that tests the function's correctness in the "test_tuple" field. This must strictly contain single-line assert statements only; any setup code for the test must be filled in the "test_setup_code" field.
3) The function name which you gave must be called in the assert statements. 

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.

INFO - [Task id] 77 [prompt] Question 1: How do you implement a binary search algorithm in Python?
Answer: To implement a binary search algorithm in Python, you can use either an iterative or a recursive approach. Below are examples of both methods.

### Iterative Approach

```python
def binary_search_iterative(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To avoid overflow
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Target found
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1  # Search in the right half
        else:
            right = mid - 1  # Search in the left half
            
    return -1  # Target not found
```

### Recursive Approach

```python
def binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, right):
    if left > right:
        return -1  # Target not found
    
    mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To avoid overflow
    
    if arr[mid] == target:
        return mid  # Target found
    elif arr[mid] < target:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, mid + 1, right)  # Search in the right half
    else:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, mid - 1)  # Search in the left half

# To use the recursive function, call it like this:
# result = binary_search_recursive(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
```

### Usage Example

```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
target = 5

# Using iterative approach
result_iterative = binary_search_iterative(arr, target)
print("Iterative result:", result_iterative)

# Using recursive approach
result_recursive = binary_search_recursive(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
print("Recursive result:", result_recursive)
```

Make sure the array is sorted before performing a binary search, as the algorithm assumes a sorted input.

Question 2: What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?
Answer: The main differences between a list and a tuple in Python are:

1. **Mutability**: Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their content (add, remove, or modify elements) after they are created. Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable, which means once a tuple is created, you cannot change its content.

2. **Syntax**: Lists are defined using square brackets `[]`, while tuples are defined using parentheses `()`.

3. **Performance**: Tuples can be slightly more memory-efficient and faster than lists for certain operations because of their immutability.

4. **Use Cases**: Lists are generally used for collections of items that may need to be modified, while tuples are often used for fixed collections of items, such as coordinates or records.

Example:
```python
# List
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)  # This is allowed

# Tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
# my_tuple.append(4)  # This would raise an AttributeError
```

In summary, use lists when you need a mutable sequence and tuples when you need an immutable sequence.

Question 3: How can you use list comprehensions to create a new list in Python?
Answer: You can use list comprehensions in Python to create a new list by applying an expression to each item in an existing iterable (like a list or a range) and optionally filtering items based on a condition. The syntax for a list comprehension is:

```python
new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition]
```

Here’s a simple example:

```python
# Create a list of squares of even numbers from 0 to 9
squares_of_evens = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
print(squares_of_evens)  # Output: [0, 4, 16, 36, 64]
```

In this example, `x**2` is the expression, `x` is the item from the iterable `range(10)`, and `if x % 2 == 0` is the condition that filters the items.

Question 4: What is the purpose of the 'with' statement in Python, and how is it used?
Answer: The 'with' statement in Python is used to wrap the execution of a block of code within methods defined by a context manager. The primary purpose of the 'with' statement is to ensure that resources are properly managed, such as opening and closing files, acquiring and releasing locks, or managing network connections.

When you use the 'with' statement, it simplifies exception handling by encapsulating common preparation and cleanup tasks in so-called context managers. This means that you don't have to explicitly release resources; the context manager takes care of it for you, even if an error occurs.

Here is a common example of using the 'with' statement to work with files:

```python
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

In this example, the file 'example.txt' is opened for reading. The 'with' statement ensures that the file is properly closed after the block of code is executed, regardless of whether an exception is raised within the block. This makes the code cleaner and less error-prone.

Question 5: How can you handle exceptions in Python using try and except?
Answer: In Python, you can handle exceptions using the `try` and `except` blocks. The code that might raise an exception is placed inside the `try` block, and the code that handles the exception is placed inside the `except` block. Here’s a basic example:

```python
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
    result = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
except ZeroDivisionError:
    # Code that runs if a ZeroDivisionError occurs
    print("You cannot divide by zero!")
except Exception as e:
    # Code that runs for any other exception
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
else:
    # Code that runs if no exception occurs
    print(f"The result is {result}")
finally:
    # Code that runs no matter what (optional)
    print("Execution completed.")
```

In this example:
- The `try` block contains code that may raise an exception.
- The `except` block catches specific exceptions (like `ZeroDivisionError`) and handles them.
- The `else` block runs if no exceptions were raised in the `try` block.
- The `finally` block runs regardless of whether an exception occurred or not, which is useful for cleanup actions.

Write a Python function that takes an integer n and returns the sum of all integers from 1 to n using recursion. The function should handle positive integers greater than 0.
INFO - [Task id] 77 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of writing a Python function that calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to n using recursion, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function that takes an integer `n` as its parameter.

2. **Base Case**: Identify the base case for the recursion. In this scenario, the base case occurs when `n` is equal to 1. The sum of integers from 1 to 1 is simply 1.

3. **Recursive Case**: For the recursive case, if `n` is greater than 1, the function should return `n` plus the result of the function called with `n-1`. This effectively breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems.

4. **Input Validation**: Although the task specifies that `n` will be a positive integer greater than 0, it's good practice to ensure that the function handles unexpected inputs gracefully.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def sum_recursive(n):
    # Base case: if n is 1, return 1
    if n == 1:

    # Recursive case: return n plus the sum of integers from 1 to n-1
    else:
        return n + sum_recursive(n - 1)
```

In this function:
- When `n` is 1, it returns 1.
- For any `n` greater than 1, it adds `n` to the result of `sum_recursive(n - 1)`, effectively summing all integers from 1 to `n`.

This recursive approach continues until it reaches the base case, at which point the function starts returning values back up the call stack, ultimately yielding the total sum.

[Task]
Write a Python function that takes an integer n and returns the sum of all integers from 1 to n using recursion. The function should handle positive integers greater than 0.

The base case should be when `n` is equal to 0, not 1, because the sum of integers from 1 to 0 is 0, not 1. This is important for the recursion to terminate correctly. Also, the function name should be `recursive_sum` as specified in the task.

Plan:
1) Define the function `recursive_sum` with one parameter `n`.
2) Implement the base case: if `n` is 0, return 0.
3) Implement the recursive case: if `n` is greater than 0, return `n` plus the result of calling `recursive_sum` with `n-1`.
4) Ensure that the function only accepts positive integers greater than 0.

You are a Python programming assistant that assesses my progress of Python programming and provides useful guidance.

I will give you the following information:

[Task]: The objective I need to accomplish.
[Context]: The context of the task. Serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help me on the task, but my priority is to follow instructions in the Task tag.
[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

You should only respond in JSON format as described below:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

INFO - [Task id] 77 [prompt] [Task]:
Write a Python function that takes an integer n and returns the sum of all integers from 1 to n using recursion. The function should handle positive integers greater than 0.
[Context]: 
 Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of writing a Python function that calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to n using recursion, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function that takes an integer `n` as its parameter.

2. **Base Case**: Identify the base case for the recursion. In this scenario, the base case occurs when `n` is equal to 1. The sum of integers from 1 to 1 is simply 1.

3. **Recursive Case**: For the recursive case, if `n` is greater than 1, the function should return `n` plus the result of the function called with `n-1`. This effectively breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems.

4. **Input Validation**: Although the task specifies that `n` will be a positive integer greater than 0, it's good practice to ensure that the function handles unexpected inputs gracefully.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def sum_recursive(n):
    # Base case: if n is 1, return 1
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    # Recursive case: return n plus the sum of integers from 1 to n-1
    else:
        return n + sum_recursive(n - 1)
```

In this function:
- When `n` is 1, it returns 1.
- For any `n` greater than 1, it adds `n` to the result of `sum_recursive(n - 1)`, effectively summing all integers from 1 to `n`.

This recursive approach continues until it reaches the base case, at which point the function starts returning values back up the call stack, ultimately yielding the total sum.

The main function is `recursive_sum`.
INFO - [Task id] 77 [generation text] This function calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to a given non-negative integer n using recursion. It checks if n is zero, in which case it returns 0, indicating the base case of the recursion. If n is not zero, it adds n to the result of the function called with n decremented by 1. This process continues until n reaches zero, at which point the accumulated sum is returned. The function effectively computes the sum by breaking the problem down into smaller subproblems. It demonstrates a classic example of using recursion to solve a mathematical summation problem.
