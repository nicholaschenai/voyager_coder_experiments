You are a helpful assistant that asks questions to help me decide the next immediate task to do for Python programming.
My ultimate goal is to solve as many diverse problems as possible and become the best programmer in the world.

I will give you the following information:
Completed tasks so far: ...
Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should ask at least 5 questions (but no more than 10 questions) to help me decide the next immediate task to do. Each question should be followed by the concept that the question is about.
2) Your question should be specific to a concept in Python programming.
  Bad example (the question is too general):
    Question: What is the best way to program in Python?
    Concept: unknown
  Good example:
    Question: How do you reverse a list?
    Concept: list
3) Your questions should be self-contained and not require any context.

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:

INFO - [Task id] 67 [prompt] Question: How can you use recursion to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem?
INFO - [Task id] 67 [generation text] Answer: The Tower of Hanoi is a classic problem that can be solved using recursion. The problem involves moving a stack of disks from one peg to another, using a third peg as an auxiliary, following these rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty peg.
3. No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem recursively, you can follow these steps:

1. Move the top `n-1` disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg.
2. Move the nth disk (the largest disk) from the source peg to the destination peg.
3. Move the `n-1` disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.

Here is a Python implementation of the recursive solution:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, destination, auxiliary):
    if n == 1:
        print(f"Move disk 1 from {source} to {destination}")
        return
    tower_of_hanoi(n - 1, source, auxiliary, destination)
    print(f"Move disk {n} from {source} to {destination}")
    tower_of_hanoi(n - 1, auxiliary, destination, source)

# Example usage:
n = 3  # Number of disks
tower_of_hanoi(n, 'A', 'C', 'B')  # A, B and C are names of rods
```

In this code:
- The function `tower_of_hanoi` takes four parameters: the number of disks `n`, the source peg, the destination peg, and the auxiliary peg.
- The base case is when there is only one disk, which can be moved directly from the source to the destination.
- The recursive calls handle moving the `n-1` disks and the nth disk as described.

This approach effectively breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems, which is the essence of recursion.

Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. As a rule of thumb, guide me through beginner problems, followed by interview level problems, followed by competitive programming problems. The latter 2 levels can involve concepts from data structures and algorithms.
2) Please be very specific about what skills I need to learn.
3) Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for problems which I have not solved yet. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) The task should involve writing a main Python function that at most use basic libraries (try not to import too many or too advanced modules)
7) Do not give tasks that require file operations (create, read, update, delete) or an internet connection.
8) I am only allowed to write Python functions, so do not require me to write other things (e.g. objects). 
9) Requiring me to write a function that takes in an object and uses object methods is still ok, but I cannot define the objects myself. You must provide the objects as input to my function in the assert statement.

Take note of these in your response:
1) Give an expected function name for the task.
2) Give a tuple of 3 assert statements that tests the function's correctness in the "test_tuple" field. This must strictly contain single-line assert statements only; any setup code for the test must be filled in the "test_setup_code" field.
3) The function name which you gave must be called in the assert statements. 

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.

INFO - [Task id] 67 [prompt] Question 1: How do you implement a binary search algorithm in Python?
Answer: To implement a binary search algorithm in Python, you can use either an iterative or a recursive approach. Below are examples of both methods.

### Iterative Approach

```python
def binary_search_iterative(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To avoid overflow
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Target found
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1  # Search in the right half
        else:
            right = mid - 1  # Search in the left half
            
    return -1  # Target not found
```

### Recursive Approach

```python
def binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, right):
    if left > right:
        return -1  # Target not found
    
    mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To avoid overflow
    
    if arr[mid] == target:
        return mid  # Target found
    elif arr[mid] < target:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, mid + 1, right)  # Search in the right half
    else:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, mid - 1)  # Search in the left half

# To use the recursive function, call it like this:
# result = binary_search_recursive(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
```

### Usage Example

```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
target = 5

# Using iterative approach
result_iterative = binary_search_iterative(arr, target)
print("Iterative result:", result_iterative)

# Using recursive approach
result_recursive = binary_search_recursive(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
print("Recursive result:", result_recursive)
```

Make sure the array is sorted before performing a binary search, as the algorithm assumes a sorted input.

Question 2: How can you find the longest common prefix among a list of strings?
Answer: To find the longest common prefix among a list of strings in Python, you can use the following approach:

1. Check if the list is empty. If it is, return an empty string.
2. Take the first string as a reference and compare it with the other strings.
3. Iterate through the characters of the reference string and check if they match with the corresponding characters of the other strings.
4. Stop when a mismatch is found or when you reach the end of the reference string.

Here is a sample implementation:

```python
def longest_common_prefix(strs):
    if not strs:
        return ""
    
    # Take the first string as the reference
    prefix = strs[0]
    
    for string in strs[1:]:
        # Compare the prefix with each string
        while string[:len(prefix)] != prefix and prefix:
            # Shorten the prefix
            prefix = prefix[:-1]
    
    return prefix

# Example usage
strings = ["flower", "flow", "flight"]
print(longest_common_prefix(strings))  # Output: "fl"
```

This function will return the longest common prefix among the provided list of strings.

Question 3: How can you use recursion to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem?
Answer: The Tower of Hanoi is a classic problem that can be solved using recursion. The problem involves moving a stack of disks from one peg to another, using a third peg as an auxiliary, following these rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty peg.
3. No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem recursively, you can follow these steps:

1. Move the top `n-1` disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg.
2. Move the nth disk (the largest disk) from the source peg to the destination peg.
3. Move the `n-1` disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.

Here is a Python implementation of the recursive solution:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, destination, auxiliary):
    if n == 1:
        print(f"Move disk 1 from {source} to {destination}")
        return
    tower_of_hanoi(n - 1, source, auxiliary, destination)
    print(f"Move disk {n} from {source} to {destination}")
    tower_of_hanoi(n - 1, auxiliary, destination, source)

# Example usage:
n = 3  # Number of disks
tower_of_hanoi(n, 'A', 'C', 'B')  # A, B and C are names of rods
```

In this code:
- The function `tower_of_hanoi` takes four parameters: the number of disks `n`, the source peg, the destination peg, and the auxiliary peg.
- The base case is when there is only one disk, which can be moved directly from the source to the destination.
- The recursive calls handle moving the `n-1` disks and the nth disk as described.

This approach effectively breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems, which is the essence of recursion.

Question 4: What is the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy in Python?
Answer: A shallow copy and a deep copy in Python differ in how they handle the copying of objects, particularly when those objects contain references to other objects.

- **Shallow Copy**: A shallow copy creates a new object, but it does not create copies of the objects that are referenced by the original object. Instead, it copies the references to those objects. This means that if the original object contains mutable objects (like lists or dictionaries), changes made to those mutable objects in the shallow copy will also reflect in the original object, and vice versa. You can create a shallow copy using the `copy` module's `copy()` function or by using the `list()` constructor for lists.

  Example:
  ```python
  import copy

  original = [1, 2, [3, 4]]
  shallow_copied = copy.copy(original)

  shallow_copied[2][0] = 'changed'
  print(original)  # Output: [1, 2, ['changed', 4]]
  ```

- **Deep Copy**: A deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all objects found in the original object, meaning that it creates copies of all nested objects as well. This ensures that the new object is completely independent of the original object. You can create a deep copy using the `copy` module's `deepcopy()` function.

  Example:
  ```python
  import copy

  original = [1, 2, [3, 4]]
  deep_copied = copy.deepcopy(original)

  deep_copied[2][0] = 'changed'
  print(original)  # Output: [1, 2, [3, 4]]
  ```

In summary, use a shallow copy when you want to copy the outer object but share references to the inner objects, and use a deep copy when you want to create a completely independent copy of the entire object structure.

Question 5: How do you create a class in Python and instantiate an object from it?
Answer: To create a class in Python, you use the `class` keyword followed by the class name and a colon. Inside the class, you can define methods and attributes. To instantiate an object from the class, you simply call the class as if it were a function.

Here is an example:

```python
# Define a class
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # Instance variable for the dog's name
        self.age = age    # Instance variable for the dog's age

    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"

# Instantiate an object from the class
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)

# Accessing attributes and methods
print(my_dog.name)  # Output: Buddy
print(my_dog.age)   # Output: 3
print(my_dog.bark())  # Output: Buddy says woof!
```

In this example, we created a class `Dog` with an initializer method `__init__` to set the name and age of the dog. We then created an instance of `Dog` called `my_dog` and accessed its attributes and methods.

INFO - [Task id] 67 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
Write a Python function that performs a breadth-first search (BFS) on a graph represented as an adjacency list. The function should take two arguments: the graph as a dictionary where keys are nodes and values are lists of adjacent nodes, and the starting node. The function should return a list of nodes in the order they are visited during the BFS traversal.
INFO - [Task id] 67 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish a breadth-first search (BFS) on a graph represented as an adjacency list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Initialize Data Structures**: 
   - Create a queue to keep track of the nodes to be visited. You can use Python's `collections.deque` for efficient popping from the front.
   - Create a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid processing the same node multiple times.
   - Create a list to store the order of visited nodes.

2. **Start the BFS**:
   - Enqueue the starting node into the queue and mark it as visited by adding it to the visited set.

3. **Process the Queue**:
   - While the queue is not empty, do the following:
     - Dequeue a node from the front of the queue and add it to the list of visited nodes.
     - For each adjacent node of the dequeued node (obtained from the adjacency list), check if it has not been visited:
       - If it hasn't been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Once the queue is empty, return the list of visited nodes, which represents the order of traversal.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()  # To keep track of visited nodes
    queue = deque([start])  # Initialize the queue with the starting node
    visited.add(start)  # Mark the starting node as visited
    order_of_visit = []  # List to store the order of visited nodes

    while queue:
        current_node = queue.popleft()  # Dequeue a node
        order_of_visit.append(current_node)  # Record the visit

        # Iterate through adjacent nodes
        for neighbor in graph[current_node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:  # If not visited
                visited.add(neighbor)  # Mark as visited
                queue.append(neighbor)  # Enqueue the neighbor

    return order_of_visit  # Return the order of visited nodes
```

This function effectively implements the BFS algorithm, ensuring that all nodes are visited in the correct order based on their proximity to the starting node.

Write a Python function that performs a breadth-first search (BFS) on a graph represented as an adjacency list. The function should take two arguments: the graph as a dictionary where keys are nodes and values are lists of adjacent nodes, and the starting node. The function should return a list of nodes in the order they are visited during the BFS traversal.
You must strictly follow the function name: bfs_traversal

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish a breadth-first search (BFS) on a graph represented as an adjacency list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Initialize Data Structures**: 
   - Create a queue to keep track of the nodes to be visited. You can use Python's `collections.deque` for efficient popping from the front.
   - Create a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid processing the same node multiple times.
   - Create a list to store the order of visited nodes.

2. **Start the BFS**:
   - Enqueue the starting node into the queue and mark it as visited by adding it to the visited set.

3. **Process the Queue**:
   - While the queue is not empty, do the following:
     - Dequeue a node from the front of the queue and add it to the list of visited nodes.
     - For each adjacent node of the dequeued node (obtained from the adjacency list), check if it has not been visited:
       - If it hasn't been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Once the queue is empty, return the list of visited nodes, which represents the order of traversal.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()  # To keep track of visited nodes
    queue = deque([start])  # Initialize the queue with the starting node
    visited.add(start)  # Mark the starting node as visited
    order_of_visit = []  # List to store the order of visited nodes

    while queue:
        current_node = queue.popleft()  # Dequeue a node
        order_of_visit.append(current_node)  # Record the visit

        # Iterate through adjacent nodes
        for neighbor in graph[current_node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:  # If not visited
                visited.add(neighbor)  # Mark as visited
                queue.append(neighbor)  # Enqueue the neighbor

    return order_of_visit  # Return the order of visited nodes
```

This function effectively implements the BFS algorithm, ensuring that all nodes are visited in the correct order based on their proximity to the starting node.

INFO - [Task id] 67 [generation text] Plan:
1) Define the function `bfs_traversal` with parameters `graph` and `start`.
2) Initialize a queue using `collections.deque` and enqueue the starting node.
3) Initialize a set to keep track of visited nodes and add the starting node to it.
4) Initialize a list to store the order of visited nodes.
5) While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node from the front of the queue.
6) Add the dequeued node to the list of visited nodes.
7) Iterate over each adjacent node of the dequeued node.
8) If an adjacent node has not been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it.
9) After the queue is empty, return the list of visited nodes.

Code:
```python
from collections import deque

def bfs_traversal(graph, start):
    visited = set()  # Set to keep track of visited nodes
    queue = deque([start])  # Queue to keep track of nodes to visit
    visited.add(start)  # Mark the starting node as visited
    order_of_visit = []  # List to store the order of visited nodes

    while queue:
        current_node = queue.popleft()  # Dequeue a node from the front of the queue
        order_of_visit.append(current_node)  # Add it to the list of visited nodes

        # Iterate through the adjacent nodes
        for neighbor in graph[current_node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:  # If the neighbor hasn't been visited

                queue.append(neighbor)  # Enqueue the neighbor

    return order_of_visit  # Return the list of visited nodes
```

This code follows the BFS algorithm and should return the nodes in the order they are visited starting from the given start node.

You are a Python programming assistant that assesses my progress of Python programming and provides useful guidance.

I will give you the following information:

[Task]: The objective I need to accomplish.
[Context]: The context of the task. Serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help me on the task, but my priority is to follow instructions in the Task tag.
[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

You should only respond in JSON format as described below:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.
