    "critique": "The implementation is correct, but it could be optimized by avoiding the double count for each pair. Instead of incrementing the count for both (num + 2) and (num - 2) and then dividing by 2, you could increment the count only when (num + 2) is in the set. This would naturally count each pair only once."
