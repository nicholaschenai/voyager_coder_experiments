You are a helpful assistant that asks questions to help me decide the next immediate task to do for Python programming.
My ultimate goal is to solve as many diverse problems as possible and become the best programmer in the world.

I will give you the following information:
Completed tasks so far: ...
Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should ask at least 5 questions (but no more than 10 questions) to help me decide the next immediate task to do. Each question should be followed by the concept that the question is about.
2) Your question should be specific to a concept in Python programming.
  Bad example (the question is too general):
    Question: What is the best way to program in Python?
    Concept: unknown
  Good example:
    Question: How do you reverse a list?
    Concept: list
3) Your questions should be self-contained and not require any context.

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

INFO - [Task id] 86 [prompt] Question: What is the best way to find the longest palindrome that can be formed by rearranging the letters of a string?
INFO - [Task id] 86 [generation text] Answer: To find the longest palindrome that can be formed by rearranging the letters of a string, you can follow these steps:

1. **Count the Frequency of Each Character**: Use a dictionary or a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count how many times each character appears in the string.

2. **Determine the Palindrome Structure**:
   - A palindrome can have at most one character with an odd count (which would be placed in the center of the palindrome), while all other characters must have even counts.
   - For each character with an even count, you can use all of them in the palindrome. For characters with an odd count, you can use the largest even number less than the count (i.e., `count - 1`).

3. **Construct the Palindrome**:
   - Create half of the palindrome using the characters with even counts and the largest even counts from characters with odd counts.
   - If there is a character with an odd count, you can place it in the middle.
   - The second half of the palindrome is simply the reverse of the first half.

Here is a sample implementation in Python:

```python
from collections import Counter

def longest_palindrome(s):
    char_count = Counter(s)
    half_palindrome = []
    odd_char = ''
    
    for char, count in char_count.items():
        if count % 2 == 0:
            half_palindrome.append(char * (count // 2))
        else:
            half_palindrome.append(char * (count // 2))
            if len(odd_char) == 0 or count > char_count[odd_char]:
                odd_char = char
    
    first_half = ''.join(half_palindrome)
    second_half = first_half[::-1]
    
    return first_half + odd_char + second_half

# Example usage:
result = longest_palindrome("abccccdd")
print(result)  # Output could be "dccaccd" or similar
```

This function will return the longest palindrome that can be formed by rearranging the letters of the input string.

INFO - [Task id] 86 [prompt] Question: How can you find the length of the longest subarray where the sum of the elements is equal to zero?
INFO - [Task id] 86 [generation text] Answer: To find the length of the longest subarray where the sum of the elements is equal to zero, you can use a hash map (dictionary in Python) to store the cumulative sum and its corresponding index. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the cumulative sum and a variable to store the maximum length of the subarray found.
2. Create a dictionary to map the cumulative sum to its first occurrence index.
3. Iterate through the array, updating the cumulative sum at each step.
4. If the cumulative sum is zero, update the maximum length to the current index + 1.
5. If the cumulative sum has been seen before, calculate the length of the subarray from the first occurrence of this sum to the current index and update the maximum length if this length is greater than the previously recorded maximum.
6. If the cumulative sum has not been seen before, store it in the dictionary with the current index.

Here is a sample implementation in Python:

```python
def max_length_zero_sum_subarray(arr):
    sum_map = {}
    cumulative_sum = 0
    max_length = 0

    for i in range(len(arr)):
        cumulative_sum += arr[i]

        # Check if cumulative sum is zero
        if cumulative_sum == 0:
            max_length = i + 1

        # Check if cumulative sum has been seen before
        if cumulative_sum in sum_map:
            # Calculate the length of the subarray
            length = i - sum_map[cumulative_sum]
            max_length = max(max_length, length)
        else:
            # Store the index of the first occurrence of the cumulative sum
            sum_map[cumulative_sum] = i

    return max_length

# Example usage
arr = [1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3]
print(max_length_zero_sum_subarray(arr))  # Output: 6
```

This function will return the length of the longest subarray where the sum of the elements is equal to zero.

INFO - [Task id] 86 [prompt] Question: What is the approach to assign tasks to workers such that the time to complete all tasks is minimized?
INFO - [Task id] 86 [generation text] Answer: The approach to assign tasks to workers in a way that minimizes the total time to complete all tasks is often referred to as the "task scheduling problem." One common method to achieve this is through the use of algorithms such as:

1. **Greedy Algorithms**: These algorithms make a series of choices, each of which looks best at the moment. For example, you can assign each task to the worker who is currently available and has the least workload.

2. **Dynamic Programming**: This approach can be used for more complex scenarios where tasks have different weights or dependencies. It breaks the problem down into simpler subproblems and builds up solutions to larger problems.

3. **Load Balancing**: This involves distributing tasks evenly across workers to ensure that no single worker is overwhelmed, which can be done using techniques like round-robin scheduling or more sophisticated algorithms that consider the current load of each worker.

4. **Integer Linear Programming (ILP)**: For optimal solutions, especially in cases with constraints, ILP can be used to formulate the problem mathematically and find the best assignment of tasks to workers.

5. **Heuristic Methods**: In cases where the problem size is large, heuristic methods like genetic algorithms or simulated annealing can be employed to find a good enough solution in a reasonable time.

Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. As a rule of thumb, guide me through beginner problems, followed by interview level problems, followed by competitive programming problems. The latter 2 levels can involve concepts from data structures and algorithms.
2) Please be very specific about what skills I need to learn.
3) Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for problems which I have not solved yet. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) The task should involve writing a main Python function that at most use basic libraries (try not to import too many or too advanced modules)
7) Do not give tasks that require file operations (create, read, update, delete) or an internet connection.
8) I am only allowed to write Python functions, so do not require me to write other things (e.g. objects). 
9) Requiring me to write a function that takes in an object and uses object methods is still ok, but I cannot define the objects myself. You must provide the objects as input to my function in the assert statement.

Take note of these in your response:
1) Give an expected function name for the task.
2) Give a tuple of 3 assert statements that tests the function's correctness in the "test_tuple" field. This must strictly contain single-line assert statements only; any setup code for the test must be filled in the "test_setup_code" field.
3) The function name which you gave must be called in the assert statements. 

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}

INFO - [Task id] 86 [prompt] Question 1: How can you implement a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm on a graph represented as an adjacency list?
Answer: To implement a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm on a graph represented as an adjacency list, you can use either a recursive approach or an iterative approach using a stack. Below is an example of both methods in Python.

### Graph Representation
First, let's represent the graph as an adjacency list using a dictionary:

```python
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['D', 'E'],
    'C': ['F'],
    'D': [],
    'E': ['F'],
    'F': []
}
```

### Recursive DFS Implementation
Here is how you can implement DFS recursively:

```python
def dfs_recursive(node, visited):
    if node not in visited:
        print(node)  # Process the node (e.g., print it)
        visited.add(node)  # Mark the node as visited
        for neighbor in graph[node]:  # Visit all the neighbors
            dfs_recursive(neighbor, visited)

# Usage
visited = set()
dfs_recursive('A', visited)
```

### Iterative DFS Implementation
Here is how you can implement DFS iteratively using a stack:

```python
def dfs_iterative(start):
    visited = set()  # To keep track of visited nodes
    stack = [start]  # Initialize the stack with the starting node

    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()  # Get the last node added to the stack
        if node not in visited:
            print(node)  # Process the node (e.g., print it)
            visited.add(node)  # Mark the node as visited
            # Add all unvisited neighbors to the stack
            stack.extend(neighbor for neighbor in graph[node] if neighbor not in visited)

# Usage
dfs_iterative('A')
```

### Explanation
- In both implementations, we maintain a set called `visited` to keep track of the nodes that have already been visited to avoid cycles.
- In the recursive version, we call the function recursively for each unvisited neighbor.
- In the iterative version, we use a stack to keep track of the nodes to visit next, popping from the stack to process nodes.

You can choose either method based on your preference or the specific requirements of your application.

Question 2: What is the best way to find the longest palindrome that can be formed by rearranging the letters of a string?
Answer: To find the longest palindrome that can be formed by rearranging the letters of a string, you can follow these steps:

1. **Count the Frequency of Each Character**: Use a dictionary or a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count how many times each character appears in the string.

2. **Determine the Palindrome Structure**:
   - A palindrome can have at most one character with an odd count (which would be placed in the center of the palindrome), while all other characters must have even counts.
   - For each character with an even count, you can use all of them in the palindrome. For characters with an odd count, you can use the largest even number less than the count (i.e., `count - 1`).

3. **Construct the Palindrome**:
   - Create half of the palindrome using the characters with even counts and the largest even counts from characters with odd counts.
   - If there is a character with an odd count, you can place it in the middle.
   - The second half of the palindrome is simply the reverse of the first half.

Here is a sample implementation in Python:

```python
from collections import Counter

def longest_palindrome(s):
    char_count = Counter(s)
    half_palindrome = []
    odd_char = ''
    
    for char, count in char_count.items():
        if count % 2 == 0:
            half_palindrome.append(char * (count // 2))
        else:
            half_palindrome.append(char * (count // 2))
            if len(odd_char) == 0 or count > char_count[odd_char]:
                odd_char = char
    
    first_half = ''.join(half_palindrome)
    second_half = first_half[::-1]
    
    return first_half + odd_char + second_half

# Example usage:
result = longest_palindrome("abccccdd")
print(result)  # Output could be "dccaccd" or similar
```

This function will return the longest palindrome that can be formed by rearranging the letters of the input string.

Question 3: How can you find the length of the longest subarray where the sum of the elements is equal to zero?
Answer: To find the length of the longest subarray where the sum of the elements is equal to zero, you can use a hash map (dictionary in Python) to store the cumulative sum and its corresponding index. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the cumulative sum and a variable to store the maximum length of the subarray found.
2. Create a dictionary to map the cumulative sum to its first occurrence index.
3. Iterate through the array, updating the cumulative sum at each step.
4. If the cumulative sum is zero, update the maximum length to the current index + 1.
5. If the cumulative sum has been seen before, calculate the length of the subarray from the first occurrence of this sum to the current index and update the maximum length if this length is greater than the previously recorded maximum.
6. If the cumulative sum has not been seen before, store it in the dictionary with the current index.

Here is a sample implementation in Python:

```python
def max_length_zero_sum_subarray(arr):
    sum_map = {}
    cumulative_sum = 0
    max_length = 0

    for i in range(len(arr)):
        cumulative_sum += arr[i]

        # Check if cumulative sum is zero
        if cumulative_sum == 0:
            max_length = i + 1

        # Check if cumulative sum has been seen before
        if cumulative_sum in sum_map:
            # Calculate the length of the subarray
            length = i - sum_map[cumulative_sum]
            max_length = max(max_length, length)
        else:
            # Store the index of the first occurrence of the cumulative sum
            sum_map[cumulative_sum] = i

    return max_length

# Example usage
arr = [1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3]
print(max_length_zero_sum_subarray(arr))  # Output: 6
```

This function will return the length of the longest subarray where the sum of the elements is equal to zero.

Question 4: What is the approach to assign tasks to workers such that the time to complete all tasks is minimized?
Answer: The approach to assign tasks to workers in a way that minimizes the total time to complete all tasks is often referred to as the "task scheduling problem." One common method to achieve this is through the use of algorithms such as:

1. **Greedy Algorithms**: These algorithms make a series of choices, each of which looks best at the moment. For example, you can assign each task to the worker who is currently available and has the least workload.

2. **Dynamic Programming**: This approach can be used for more complex scenarios where tasks have different weights or dependencies. It breaks the problem down into simpler subproblems and builds up solutions to larger problems.

3. **Load Balancing**: This involves distributing tasks evenly across workers to ensure that no single worker is overwhelmed, which can be done using techniques like round-robin scheduling or more sophisticated algorithms that consider the current load of each worker.

4. **Integer Linear Programming (ILP)**: For optimal solutions, especially in cases with constraints, ILP can be used to formulate the problem mathematically and find the best assignment of tasks to workers.

5. **Heuristic Methods**: In cases where the problem size is large, heuristic methods like genetic algorithms or simulated annealing can be employed to find a good enough solution in a reasonable time.

The choice of method depends on the specific requirements of the task assignment problem, such as the number of tasks, the number of workers, and any constraints that may exist.

Question 5: How do you find the maximum product of two distinct elements in a list?
Answer: To find the maximum product of two distinct elements in a list, you can follow these steps:

1. Sort the list in descending order.
2. The maximum product will be the product of the first two elements in the sorted list.

Here is a sample implementation in Python:

```python
def max_product(lst):
    if len(lst) < 2:
        raise ValueError("List must contain at least two distinct elements.")
    
    # Sort the list in descending order
    lst.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Return the product of the two largest distinct elements
    return lst[0] * lst[1]

# Example usage
numbers = [3, 5, 1, 7, 9]
result = max_product(numbers)
print(result)  # Output: 63 (9 * 7)
```

Alternatively, you can find the two largest distinct elements without sorting the entire list, which can be more efficient:

```python
def max_product(lst):
    if len(lst) < 2:
        raise ValueError("List must contain at least two distinct elements.")
    
    first = second = float('-inf')
    
    for number in lst:
        if number > first:
            second = first
            first = number
        elif number > second and number != first:
            second = number
    
    return first * second

# Example usage
numbers = [3, 5, 1, 7, 9]
result = max_product(numbers)
print(result)  # Output: 63 (9 * 7)
```

This approach ensures that you only traverse the list once, making it more efficient for larger lists.

	Write a Python function that takes a sorted list of integers and an integer target value, and returns a tuple of two numbers from the list that add up to the target value. If no such pair exists, return None.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of strings representing a postfix expression (each element being a number or an operator) and returns the result of the expression. The function should handle the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence. The sequence must be composed of consecutive integers, regardless of their order in the original list.
	Write a Python function that takes a string and returns a dictionary where each key is a unique word in the string and the corresponding value is the number of times that word appears in the string. The function should ignore case and punctuation.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing the difference between each adjacent pair of numbers. The output list should have one less element than the input list.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the maximum product of two distinct elements in the list. The function should handle lists with at least two integers.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the number of elements in the list that are greater than the sum of all previous elements in the list. For example, in the list [1, 2, 4, 1, 6], the elements 4 and 6 are greater than the sum of all previous elements (1+2 and 1+2+4+1, respectively).
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the longest subarray where the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the subarray is at most 1. The function should return the length of this subarray.
	Write a Python function that takes a string and returns the longest palindrome that can be formed by rearranging its letters. If it is not possible to form any palindrome, return an empty string.
	Write a Python function that takes a string and returns the length of the longest substring with at most two distinct characters. For example, given the string 'aabacbebebe', the longest substring with at most two distinct characters is 'cbebebe', so the function should return 7.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the length of the longest subarray where the sum of the elements is equal to zero. If no such subarray exists, return 0.
	Write a Python function that takes an array of non-negative integers representing the amount of time it takes to complete a task and an integer k representing the number of workers. The function should assign tasks to workers such that the time to complete all tasks is minimized assuming each worker can only work on one task at a time. The function should return the minimum time required to complete all tasks.

INFO - [Task id] 86 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
Write a Python function that takes a graph represented as an adjacency matrix and returns a list of nodes in the order they are visited using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The function should start the BFS from the first node (index 0).
INFO - [Task id] 86 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of implementing a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm in Python using an adjacency matrix, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand the Graph Representation**: An adjacency matrix is a 2D list (or array) where the element at row `i` and column `j` indicates whether there is an edge between node `i` and node `j`. If there is an edge, the value is typically `1` (or `True`), and if there isn't, the value is `0` (or `False`).

2. **Initialize Data Structures**:
   - Create a list to keep track of visited nodes to avoid processing the same node multiple times.
   - Use a queue (which can be implemented using a list or `collections.deque`) to manage the nodes to be explored in the BFS order.

3. **Start BFS from the First Node**:
   - Enqueue the starting node (index 0) and mark it as visited.
   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node, process it (e.g., add it to the result list), and enqueue all its unvisited neighbors.

4. **Process Neighbors**:
   - For each node dequeued, check its corresponding row in the adjacency matrix to find its neighbors (i.e., other nodes that are directly connected).
   - If a neighbor hasn't been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it.

5. **Return the Result**: Once all reachable nodes have been processed, return the list of nodes in the order they were visited.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def bfs_adjacency_matrix(adj_matrix):
    visited = []
    queue = []
    result = []
    
    # Start with the first node (index 0)
    queue.append(0)
    visited.append(0)
    
    while queue:
        # Dequeue a node
        current_node = queue.pop(0)
        result.append(current_node)
        
        # Check for unvisited neighbors
        for neighbor in range(len(adj_matrix[current_node])):
            if adj_matrix[current_node][neighbor] == 1 and neighbor not in visited:
                visited.append(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)
    
    return result
```

This function will perform a BFS traversal starting from the first node and return the order of nodes visited.

Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests

[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

To overcome this error, we should change the condition to only update the result when the current subarray length is strictly greater than the previous longest subarray length.

This results in a runtime error when right goes beyond the list length. To overcome this error, we need to add a bounds check for the right variable in the mentioned while loop. We can modify the loop condition to while right < len(nums) and current_sum + nums[right] <= target:. This change will ensure that we only access elements within the bounds of the list, thus avoiding the IndexError."

INFO - [Task id] 86 [prompt] [Task]:
Write a Python function that takes a graph represented as an adjacency matrix and returns a list of nodes in the order they are visited using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The function should start the BFS from the first node (index 0).
[Context]: 
 Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of implementing a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm in Python using an adjacency matrix, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand the Graph Representation**: An adjacency matrix is a 2D list (or array) where the element at row `i` and column `j` indicates whether there is an edge between node `i` and node `j`. If there is an edge, the value is typically `1` (or `True`), and if there isn't, the value is `0` (or `False`).

2. **Initialize Data Structures**:
   - Create a list to keep track of visited nodes to avoid processing the same node multiple times.
   - Use a queue (which can be implemented using a list or `collections.deque`) to manage the nodes to be explored in the BFS order.

3. **Start BFS from the First Node**:
   - Enqueue the starting node (index 0) and mark it as visited.
   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node, process it (e.g., add it to the result list), and enqueue all its unvisited neighbors.

4. **Process Neighbors**:
   - For each node dequeued, check its corresponding row in the adjacency matrix to find its neighbors (i.e., other nodes that are directly connected).
   - If a neighbor hasn't been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it.

5. **Return the Result**: Once all reachable nodes have been processed, return the list of nodes in the order they were visited.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def bfs_adjacency_matrix(adj_matrix):
    visited = []
    queue = []
    result = []
    
    # Start with the first node (index 0)
    queue.append(0)
    visited.append(0)
    
    while queue:
        # Dequeue a node
        current_node = queue.pop(0)
        result.append(current_node)
        
        # Check for unvisited neighbors
        for neighbor in range(len(adj_matrix[current_node])):
            if adj_matrix[current_node][neighbor] == 1 and neighbor not in visited:
                visited.append(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)
    
    return result
```

This function will perform a BFS traversal starting from the first node and return the order of nodes visited.

[Task]
Write a Python function that takes a graph represented as an adjacency matrix and returns a list of nodes in the order they are visited using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The function should start the BFS from the first node (index 0).
You must strictly follow the function name: bfs_adjacency_matrix

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of implementing a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm in Python using an adjacency matrix, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand the Graph Representation**: An adjacency matrix is a 2D list (or array) where the element at row `i` and column `j` indicates whether there is an edge between node `i` and node `j`. If there is an edge, the value is typically `1` (or `True`), and if there isn't, the value is `0` (or `False`).

2. **Initialize Data Structures**:
   - Create a list to keep track of visited nodes to avoid processing the same node multiple times.
   - Use a queue (which can be implemented using a list or `collections.deque`) to manage the nodes to be explored in the BFS order.

3. **Start BFS from the First Node**:
   - Enqueue the starting node (index 0) and mark it as visited.
   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node, process it (e.g., add it to the result list), and enqueue all its unvisited neighbors.

4. **Process Neighbors**:
   - For each node dequeued, check its corresponding row in the adjacency matrix to find its neighbors (i.e., other nodes that are directly connected).
   - If a neighbor hasn't been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it.

5. **Return the Result**: Once all reachable nodes have been processed, return the list of nodes in the order they were visited.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def bfs_adjacency_matrix(adj_matrix):
    visited = []
    queue = []
    result = []
    
    # Start with the first node (index 0)
    queue.append(0)
    visited.append(0)
    
    while queue:
        # Dequeue a node
        current_node = queue.pop(0)
        result.append(current_node)
        
        # Check for unvisited neighbors
        for neighbor in range(len(adj_matrix[current_node])):
            if adj_matrix[current_node][neighbor] == 1 and neighbor not in visited:
                visited.append(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)
    
    return result
```

This function will perform a BFS traversal starting from the first node and return the order of nodes visited.


[Critique]
To fix the issue, the implementation should mark nodes as visited immediately when they are first encountered, not when they are dequeued. This can be done by moving the line 'visited.append(neighbor)' to right after the 'if' condition that checks for connectivity and before the node is enqueued.


INFO - [Task id] 86 [generation text] Explain: The issue with the previous code is that it appends nodes to the `visited` list after dequeuing them, which can lead to the same node being enqueued multiple times before it is actually visited. This results in incorrect BFS traversal, as seen in the failed tests.

Plan:
1) Initialize an empty list `visited` to keep track of visited nodes.
2) Initialize a queue with the first node (index 0) and mark it as visited by adding it to the `visited` list.
3) Initialize an empty list `visited_order` to keep track of the order in which nodes are visited.
4) While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node from the queue and add it to the `visited_order` list.
5) Iterate over the adjacency matrix row corresponding to the dequeued node.
6) For each neighbor, if there is an edge (value is 1 or True) and the neighbor has not been visited, mark it as visited by adding it to the `visited` list and enqueue the neighbor.
7) Return the `visited_order` list after the queue is empty.

[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

{
    "reasoning": "The implementation failed the test case where no subarray fulfills the condition",
    "success": false,
    "critique": "The issue in the implementation is due to the use of >= instead of > in the condition to update the result. Because of this, it returns a subarray even when the sum is greater than the target, as it still updates the result when the current subarray length is equal to the previous longest subarray length. To overcome this error, we should change the condition to only update the result when the current subarray length is strictly greater than the previous longest subarray length. This can be done by replacing >= with > in the condition."

RESPONSE:
{
    "reason": "The implementation failed 4 out of the 7 test cases due to an IndexError.",
    "success": false,
    "critique": "The issue stems from the while loop while current_sum + nums[right] <= target:, which directly accesses nums[right] without checking if right is within the bounds of the list. This results in a runtime error when right goes beyond the list length. To overcome this error, we need to add a bounds check for the right variable in the mentioned while loop. We can modify the loop condition to while right < len(nums) and current_sum + nums[right] <= target:. This change will ensure that we only access elements within the bounds of the list, thus avoiding the IndexError."

INFO - [Task id] 86 [prompt] [Task]:
Write a Python function that takes a graph represented as an adjacency matrix and returns a list of nodes in the order they are visited using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The function should start the BFS from the first node (index 0).
[Context]: 
 Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of implementing a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm in Python using an adjacency matrix, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand the Graph Representation**: An adjacency matrix is a 2D list (or array) where the element at row `i` and column `j` indicates whether there is an edge between node `i` and node `j`. If there is an edge, the value is typically `1` (or `True`), and if there isn't, the value is `0` (or `False`).

2. **Initialize Data Structures**:
   - Create a list to keep track of visited nodes to avoid processing the same node multiple times.
   - Use a queue (which can be implemented using a list or `collections.deque`) to manage the nodes to be explored in the BFS order.

3. **Start BFS from the First Node**:
   - Enqueue the starting node (index 0) and mark it as visited.
   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node, process it (e.g., add it to the result list), and enqueue all its unvisited neighbors.

4. **Process Neighbors**:
   - For each node dequeued, check its corresponding row in the adjacency matrix to find its neighbors (i.e., other nodes that are directly connected).
   - If a neighbor hasn't been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it.

5. **Return the Result**: Once all reachable nodes have been processed, return the list of nodes in the order they were visited.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def bfs_adjacency_matrix(adj_matrix):
    visited = []
    queue = []
    result = []
    
    # Start with the first node (index 0)
    queue.append(0)
    visited.append(0)
    
    while queue:
        # Dequeue a node
        current_node = queue.pop(0)
        result.append(current_node)
        
        # Check for unvisited neighbors
        for neighbor in range(len(adj_matrix[current_node])):
            if adj_matrix[current_node][neighbor] == 1 and neighbor not in visited:
                visited.append(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)
    
    return result
```

This function will perform a BFS traversal starting from the first node and return the order of nodes visited.

The main function is `bfs_adjacency_matrix`.
INFO - [Task id] 86 [generation text] This function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) on a graph represented by an adjacency matrix, starting from the first node (index 0). It maintains a set of visited nodes to avoid processing the same node multiple times and uses a queue to explore neighboring nodes. As it traverses the graph, it records the order in which nodes are visited. The function iterates through the neighbors of the current node, adding unvisited and connected neighbors to the queue. Finally, it returns a list of nodes in the order they were visited. This approach effectively explores all reachable nodes from the starting point in a systematic manner.
