Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. As a rule of thumb, guide me through beginner problems, followed by interview level problems, followed by competitive programming problems. The latter 2 levels can involve concepts from data structures and algorithms.
2) Please be very specific about what skills I need to learn.
3) Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for problems which I have not solved yet. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) The task should involve writing a main Python function that at most use basic libraries (try not to import too many or too advanced modules)
7) Do not give tasks that require file operations (create, read, update, delete) or an internet connection.
8) I am only allowed to write Python functions, so do not require me to write other things (e.g. objects). 
9) Requiring me to write a function that takes in an object and uses object methods is still ok, but I cannot define the objects myself. You must provide the objects as input to my function in the assert statement.

Take note of these in your response:
1) Give an expected function name for the task.
2) Give a tuple of 3 assert statements that tests the function's correctness in the "test_tuple" field. This must strictly contain single-line assert statements only; any setup code for the test must be filled in the "test_setup_code" field.
3) The function name which you gave must be called in the assert statements.

}

INFO - [Task id] 22 [prompt] Question 1: How do you implement a binary search algorithm in Python?
Answer: To implement a binary search algorithm in Python, you can use either an iterative or a recursive approach. Below are examples of both methods.

### Iterative Approach

```python
def binary_search_iterative(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To avoid overflow
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Target found
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1  # Search in the right half
        else:
            right = mid - 1  # Search in the left half
            
    return -1  # Target not found
```

### Recursive Approach

```python
def binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, right):
    if left > right:
        return -1  # Target not found
    
    mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To avoid overflow
    
    if arr[mid] == target:
        return mid  # Target found
    elif arr[mid] < target:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, mid + 1, right)  # Search in the right half
    else:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, mid - 1)  # Search in the left half

# To use the recursive function, call it like this:
# result = binary_search_recursive(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
```

### Usage Example

```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
target = 5

# Using iterative approach
result_iterative = binary_search_iterative(arr, target)
print("Iterative result:", result_iterative)

# Using recursive approach
result_recursive = binary_search_recursive(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
print("Recursive result:", result_recursive)
```

Make sure the array is sorted before performing a binary search, as the algorithm assumes a sorted input.

Question 2: What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python, and when would you use each?
Answer: The main differences between a list and a tuple in Python are:

1. **Mutability**: 
   - Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their content (add, remove, or modify elements) after they are created.
   - Tuples are immutable, meaning once they are created, their content cannot be changed.

2. **Syntax**: 
   - Lists are defined using square brackets, e.g., `my_list = [1, 2, 3]`.
   - Tuples are defined using parentheses, e.g., `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)`.

3. **Performance**: 
   - Tuples can be slightly more memory-efficient and faster than lists due to their immutability, which allows for optimizations.

4. **Use Cases**:
   - Use a list when you need a collection of items that may change over time, such as a list of user inputs or a collection of items that you will modify.
   - Use a tuple when you need a fixed collection of items that should not change, such as coordinates (x, y) or a set of constants.

In summary, choose lists for mutable collections and tuples for immutable collections.

Question 3: How do you merge two dictionaries in Python?
Answer: You can merge two dictionaries in Python using several methods. Here are a few common ways:

1. **Using the `update()` method**:
   ```python
   dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
   dict2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}
   dict1.update(dict2)
   # dict1 is now {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
   ```

2. **Using the `**` unpacking operator (Python 3.5+)**:
   ```python
   dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
   dict2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}
   merged_dict = {**dict1, **dict2}
   # merged_dict is {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
   ```

3. **Using the `|` operator (Python 3.9+)**:
   ```python
   dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
   dict2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}
   merged_dict = dict1 | dict2
   # merged_dict is {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
   ```

4. **Using dictionary comprehension**:
   ```python
   dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
   dict2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}
   merged_dict = {k: v for d in (dict1, dict2) for k, v in d.items()}
   # merged_dict is {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
   ```

Choose the method that best fits your needs based on the version of Python you are using and your specific requirements.

Question 4: What are list comprehensions and how do you use them?
Answer: List comprehensions are a concise way to create lists in Python. They provide a syntactic shortcut for generating lists based on existing lists or other iterable objects. The basic syntax of a list comprehension is:

```python
[expression for item in iterable if condition]
```

- `expression` is the value to be included in the new list.
- `item` is the variable that takes the value of each element in the iterable.
- `iterable` is any Python iterable (like a list, tuple, or string).
- `condition` is an optional filter that determines whether the `expression` should be included in the new list.

Here are a few examples of how to use list comprehensions:

1. **Creating a list of squares:**
   ```python
   squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
   # squares will be [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
   ```

2. **Filtering even numbers:**
   ```python
   even_numbers = [x for x in range(20) if x % 2 == 0]
   # even_numbers will be [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]
   ```

3. **Converting strings to uppercase:**
   ```python
   words = ['hello', 'world', 'python']
   uppercase_words = [word.upper() for word in words]
   # uppercase_words will be ['HELLO', 'WORLD', 'PYTHON']
   ```

List comprehensions can make your code more readable and concise, especially when dealing with simple transformations and filtering of lists.

Question 5: How can you handle exceptions in Python using try and except?
Answer: In Python, you can handle exceptions using the `try` and `except` blocks. The code that might raise an exception is placed inside the `try` block, and the code that handles the exception is placed inside the `except` block. Here’s a basic example:

```python
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
    result = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
except ZeroDivisionError:
    # Code that runs if a ZeroDivisionError occurs
    print("You cannot divide by zero!")
except Exception as e:
    # Code that runs for any other exception
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
else:
    # Code that runs if no exception occurs
    print(f"The result is {result}")
finally:
    # Code that runs no matter what (optional)
    print("Execution completed.")
```

In this example:
- The `try` block contains code that may raise an exception.
- The `except` block catches specific exceptions (like `ZeroDivisionError`) and handles them.
- The `else` block runs if no exceptions were raised in the `try` block.
- The `finally` block runs regardless of whether an exception occurred or not, which is useful for cleanup actions.

1. **Understanding Postfix Notation**: In postfix notation (also known as Reverse Polish Notation), operators follow their operands. For example, the expression "3 4 +" means "3 + 4". This eliminates the need for parentheses to dictate operation order.

2. **Using a Stack**: A stack data structure is ideal for evaluating postfix expressions. You can use a list in Python to simulate a stack. The basic idea is to iterate through each element in the input list:
   - If the element is a number, push it onto the stack.
   - If the element is an operator (like +, -, *, /), pop the required number of operands from the stack (two for binary operators), perform the operation, and push the result back onto the stack.

3. **Handling Operations**: For each operator, you will need to define how to perform the corresponding arithmetic operation. Be sure to handle division carefully to avoid division by zero errors.

4. **Final Result**: After processing all elements in the list, the final result of the expression will be the only element left in the stack.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def evaluate_postfix(expression):
    stack = []
    
    for token in expression:
        if token.isdigit():  # Check if the token is a number
            stack.append(int(token))  # Push number onto the stack
        else:  # The token is an operator
            b = stack.pop()  # Pop the top two elements
            a = stack.pop()
            if token == '+':
                result = a + b
            elif token == '-':
                result = a - b
            elif token == '*':
                result = a * b
            elif token == '/':
                result = a / b  # Handle division
            stack.append(result)  # Push the result back onto the stack
    
    return stack.pop()  # The final result is the last element in the stack
```

This function will evaluate a given postfix expression represented as a list of strings and return the computed result. Make sure to handle edge cases, such as invalid input or division by zero, as needed.

[Task]
Write a Python function that takes a list of strings representing a postfix expression (each element being a number or an operator) and returns the result of the expression. The function should handle the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
You must strictly follow the function name: evaluate_postfix

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of evaluating a postfix expression in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understanding Postfix Notation**: In postfix notation (also known as Reverse Polish Notation), operators follow their operands. For example, the expression "3 4 +" means "3 + 4". This eliminates the need for parentheses to dictate operation order.

4. **Final Result**: After processing all elements in the list, the final result of the expression will be the only element left in the stack.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def evaluate_postfix(expression):
    stack = []
    
    for token in expression:
        if token.isdigit():  # Check if the token is a number
            stack.append(int(token))  # Push number onto the stack
        else:  # The token is an operator
            b = stack.pop()  # Pop the top two elements
            a = stack.pop()
            if token == '+':
                result = a + b
            elif token == '-':
                result = a - b
            elif token == '*':
                result = a * b

                result = a / b  # Handle division
            stack.append(result)  # Push the result back onto the stack
    
    return stack.pop()  # The final result is the last element in the stack
```

This function will evaluate a given postfix expression represented as a list of strings and return the computed result. Make sure to handle edge cases, such as invalid input or division by zero, as needed.

INFO - [Task id] 22 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a rough plan for implementing the `evaluate_postfix` function. It suggests using a stack to evaluate the postfix expression and outlines the steps to handle numbers and operators. The plan seems to be complete and aligns with the standard method for evaluating postfix expressions.

Plan:
1) Define the function `evaluate_postfix` that takes a list of strings as an argument.
2) Initialize an empty list to use as a stack.
3) Iterate over each element in the input list.
4) If the element is a digit, convert it to an integer and push it onto the stack.
5) If the element is an operator, pop the last two elements from the stack as operands.
6) Perform the operation corresponding to the operator with the operands.
7) Push the result of the operation back onto the stack.
8) After processing all elements, the final result will be the only element left in the stack. Pop and return this result.

Code:
```python
def evaluate_postfix(expression):
    stack = []
    
    for token in expression:
        if token.isdigit():  # Check if the token is a number
            stack.append(int(token))  # Push number onto the stack
        else:  # The token is an operator
            b = stack.pop()  # Pop the top two elements
            a = stack.pop()
            if token == '+':
                result = a + b
            elif token == '-':
                result = a - b
            elif token == '*':
                result = a * b
            elif token == '/':
                if b == 0:
                    raise ValueError("Division by zero is not allowed.")
                result = a / b  # Handle division
            stack.append(result)  # Push the result back onto the stack
    
    return stack.pop()  # The final result is the last element in the stack
```

Note: The code assumes that the input list will contain valid postfix expressions and that the division by zero case is handled by raising a ValueError. If the input list can contain invalid expressions or other types of tokens, additional validation and error handling would be necessary.

Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable.

    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests

[Task]
Write a Python function that takes a list of strings representing a postfix expression (each element being a number or an operator) and returns the result of the expression. The function should handle the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
You must strictly follow the function name: evaluate_postfix

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of evaluating a postfix expression in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understanding Postfix Notation**: In postfix notation (also known as Reverse Polish Notation), operators follow their operands. For example, the expression "3 4 +" means "3 + 4". This eliminates the need for parentheses to dictate operation order.

2. **Using a Stack**: A stack data structure is ideal for evaluating postfix expressions. You can use a list in Python to simulate a stack. The basic idea is to iterate through each element in the input list:
   - If the element is a number, push it onto the stack.
   - If the element is an operator (like +, -, *, /), pop the required number of operands from the stack (two for binary operators), perform the operation, and push the result back onto the stack.

3. **Handling Operations**: For each operator, you will need to define how to perform the corresponding arithmetic operation. Be sure to handle division carefully to avoid division by zero errors.

4. **Final Result**: After processing all elements in the list, the final result of the expression will be the only element left in the stack.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def evaluate_postfix(expression):
    stack = []
    
    for token in expression:
        if token.isdigit():  # Check if the token is a number
            stack.append(int(token))  # Push number onto the stack
        else:  # The token is an operator
            b = stack.pop()  # Pop the top two elements
            a = stack.pop()
            if token == '+':
                result = a + b
            elif token == '-':
                result = a - b
            elif token == '*':
                result = a * b
            elif token == '/':
                result = a / b  # Handle division
            stack.append(result)  # Push the result back onto the stack
    
    return stack.pop()  # The final result is the last element in the stack
```

This function will evaluate a given postfix expression represented as a list of strings and return the computed result. Make sure to handle edge cases, such as invalid input or division by zero, as needed.


[Critique]
The issue in the implementation is that it assumes all numbers are positive because it checks if the token is a digit using token.isdigit(). This method does not recognize negative numbers as digits. To fix this, we need to modify the condition to check if the token represents a number, which can be done using a try-except block to attempt conversion to float, or by checking if the token is a digit or if it starts with a '-' and the rest is a digit.


INFO - [Task id] 22 [generation text] Explain: The current implementation fails to handle negative numbers because it uses `token.isdigit()` to check if a token is a number, which returns `False` for negative numbers (since the minus sign is not considered a digit). To handle negative numbers, we need to modify the condition that checks if a token is a number.

Plan:
1) Modify the condition that checks if a token is a number to also consider negative numbers. This can be done by checking if the token starts with a '-' and the rest of the string is a digit or if the entire token is a digit.
2) Use `float` instead of `int` for the conversion because the division operation can result in a floating-point number.
3) Return the result as a float to handle cases where division results in a non-integer value.

Code:
```python
def evaluate_postfix(expression):
    stack = []
    for token in expression:
        # Check if the token is a number (including negative numbers)
        if token.lstrip('-').isdigit():
            stack.append(float(token))  # Push number onto the stack as float
        else:
            b = stack.pop()  # Pop the top two elements
            a = stack.pop()
            if token == '+':
                result = a + b
            elif token == '-':
                result = a - b
            elif token == '*':
                result = a * b
            elif token == '/':
                if b == 0:
                    raise ValueError('Division by zero is not allowed.')
                result = a / b  # Perform division
            stack.append(result)  # Push the result back onto the stack
    
    return stack.pop()  # The final result is the last element in the stack

[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

INFO - [Task id] 22 [prompt] [Task]:
Write a Python function that takes a list of strings representing a postfix expression (each element being a number or an operator) and returns the result of the expression. The function should handle the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
[Context]: 
 Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of evaluating a postfix expression in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understanding Postfix Notation**: In postfix notation (also known as Reverse Polish Notation), operators follow their operands. For example, the expression "3 4 +" means "3 + 4". This eliminates the need for parentheses to dictate operation order.

2. **Using a Stack**: A stack data structure is ideal for evaluating postfix expressions. You can use a list in Python to simulate a stack. The basic idea is to iterate through each element in the input list:
   - If the element is a number, push it onto the stack.
   - If the element is an operator (like +, -, *, /), pop the required number of operands from the stack (two for binary operators), perform the operation, and push the result back onto the stack.

3. **Handling Operations**: For each operator, you will need to define how to perform the corresponding arithmetic operation. Be sure to handle division carefully to avoid division by zero errors.

4. **Final Result**: After processing all elements in the list, the final result of the expression will be the only element left in the stack.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def evaluate_postfix(expression):
    stack = []
    
    for token in expression:
        if token.isdigit():  # Check if the token is a number
            stack.append(int(token))  # Push number onto the stack
        else:  # The token is an operator
            b = stack.pop()  # Pop the top two elements
            a = stack.pop()
            if token == '+':
                result = a + b
            elif token == '-':
                result = a - b
            elif token == '*':
                result = a * b
            elif token == '/':
                result = a / b  # Handle division
            stack.append(result)  # Push the result back onto the stack
    
    return stack.pop()  # The final result is the last element in the stack
```

This function will evaluate a given postfix expression represented as a list of strings and return the computed result. Make sure to handle edge cases, such as invalid input or division by zero, as needed.

def evaluate_postfix(expression):
    stack = []
    for token in expression:
        if token.lstrip('-').isdigit():
            stack.append(float(token))
        else:
            b = stack.pop()
            a = stack.pop()
            if (token == '+'):
                result = (a + b)
            elif (token == '-'):
                result = (a - b)
            elif (token == '*'):
                result = (a * b)
            elif (token == '/'):
                if (b == 0):
                    raise ValueError('Division by zero is not allowed.')
                result = (a / b)

Write a Python function that takes a list of strings representing a postfix expression (each element being a number or an operator) and returns the result of the expression. The function should handle the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
You must strictly follow the function name: evaluate_postfix

4. **Final Result**: After processing all elements in the list, the final result of the expression will be the only element left in the stack.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python

    for token in expression:
        if token.isdigit():  # Check if the token is a number
            stack.append(int(token))  # Push number onto the stack
        else:  # The token is an operator
            b = stack.pop()  # Pop the top two elements
            a = stack.pop()
            if token == '+':
                result = a + b
            elif token == '-':
                result = a - b

                result = a / b  # Handle division
            stack.append(result)  # Push the result back onto the stack
    
    return stack.pop()  # The final result is the last element in the stack
```

This function will evaluate a given postfix expression represented as a list of strings and return the computed result. Make sure to handle edge cases, such as invalid input or division by zero, as needed.


[Critique]
The issue in the implementation is the use of floating-point division which can introduce precision errors. To overcome this error, consider using the Decimal module from Python's standard library for more precise arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with division. This will help to avoid precision issues and return the correct result for complex expressions.


INFO - [Task id] 22 [generation text] Explain: The failed test case indicates that the function is not handling floating-point arithmetic with the precision required to match the expected output. Floating-point arithmetic can introduce rounding errors, which is likely the cause of the discrepancy between the expected result and the actual result.

Plan:
1) Import the `Decimal` class from the `decimal` module to handle floating-point numbers with more precision.
2) Modify the `evaluate_postfix` function to convert numbers to `Decimal` before performing arithmetic operations.
3) Ensure that all arithmetic operations are performed using `Decimal` instances to maintain precision throughout the calculation.
4) Return the result as a float, since the test cases expect a float result.

Code:
```python
from decimal import Decimal

def evaluate_postfix(expression):
    stack = []
    for token in expression:
        if token.lstrip('-').replace('.', '', 1).isdigit():
            stack.append(Decimal(token))
        else:
            b = stack.pop()
            a = stack.pop()
            if token == '+':
                result = a + b
            elif token == '-':
                result = a - b
            elif token == '*':
                result = a * b
            elif token == '/':
                if b == 0:
                    raise ValueError('Division by zero is not allowed.')
                result = a / b
            stack.append(result)
    return float(stack.pop())
```

By using the `Decimal` class, we can avoid the precision errors that are common with floating-point arithmetic in Python. The final result is converted back to a float to match the expected output type.

                result = a / b
            stack.append(result)
    return float(stack.pop())
```

By using the `Decimal` class, we can avoid the precision errors that are common with floating-point arithmetic in Python. The final result is converted back to a float to match the expected output type.

, AssertionError

INFO - [Task id] 22 [generation text] Explain: The `decimal` module is not allowed in the current environment, so we cannot use it to handle floating-point precision issues. The `AssertionError` indicates that the output of the function does not match the expected result due to floating-point precision errors.

Plan:
1) Instead of using the `decimal` module, we will round the result of each operation to a certain number of decimal places to mitigate floating-point precision errors. This is not a perfect solution but should work for the given test cases.
2) Modify the `evaluate_postfix` function to round the result of each arithmetic operation to a reasonable number of decimal places (e.g., 10).
3) Return the result as a float, ensuring that it matches the expected output format.

Code:
```python
def evaluate_postfix(expression):
    stack = []
    for token in expression:
        if token.lstrip('-').replace('.', '', 1).isdigit():
            stack.append(float(token))
        else:
            b = stack.pop()
            a = stack.pop()
            if token == '+':
                result = a + b
            elif token == '-':
                result = a - b
            elif token == '*':
                result = a * b

                result = a / b
            # Round the result to 10 decimal places to reduce floating-point errors
            stack.append(round(result, 10))
    return stack.pop()
```

By rounding the result of each operation to 10 decimal places, we aim to reduce the impact of floating-point precision errors while still returning a float value that should pass the test cases.

You are a Python programming assistant that assesses my progress of Python programming and provides useful guidance.

I will give you the following information:

[Task]: The objective I need to accomplish.
[Context]: The context of the task. Serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help me on the task, but my priority is to follow instructions in the Task tag.
[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

You should only respond in JSON format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] 22 [prompt] [Task]:
Write a Python function that takes a list of strings representing a postfix expression (each element being a number or an operator) and returns the result of the expression. The function should handle the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
[Context]: 
 Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of evaluating a postfix expression in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understanding Postfix Notation**: In postfix notation (also known as Reverse Polish Notation), operators follow their operands. For example, the expression "3 4 +" means "3 + 4". This eliminates the need for parentheses to dictate operation order.

2. **Using a Stack**: A stack data structure is ideal for evaluating postfix expressions. You can use a list in Python to simulate a stack. The basic idea is to iterate through each element in the input list:
   - If the element is a number, push it onto the stack.
   - If the element is an operator (like +, -, *, /), pop the required number of operands from the stack (two for binary operators), perform the operation, and push the result back onto the stack.

3. **Handling Operations**: For each operator, you will need to define how to perform the corresponding arithmetic operation. Be sure to handle division carefully to avoid division by zero errors.

4. **Final Result**: After processing all elements in the list, the final result of the expression will be the only element left in the stack.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def evaluate_postfix(expression):
    stack = []
    
    for token in expression:
        if token.isdigit():  # Check if the token is a number
            stack.append(int(token))  # Push number onto the stack
        else:  # The token is an operator
            b = stack.pop()  # Pop the top two elements
            a = stack.pop()
            if token == '+':
                result = a + b
            elif token == '-':
                result = a - b
            elif token == '*':
                result = a * b
            elif token == '/':
                result = a / b  # Handle division
            stack.append(result)  # Push the result back onto the stack
    
    return stack.pop()  # The final result is the last element in the stack
```

This function will evaluate a given postfix expression represented as a list of strings and return the computed result. Make sure to handle edge cases, such as invalid input or division by zero, as needed.

    stack = []

Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests

Write a Python function that takes a list of strings representing a postfix expression (each element being a number or an operator) and returns the result of the expression. The function should handle the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
You must strictly follow the function name: evaluate_postfix

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of evaluating a postfix expression in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understanding Postfix Notation**: In postfix notation (also known as Reverse Polish Notation), operators follow their operands. For example, the expression "3 4 +" means "3 + 4". This eliminates the need for parentheses to dictate operation order.

2. **Using a Stack**: A stack data structure is ideal for evaluating postfix expressions. You can use a list in Python to simulate a stack. The basic idea is to iterate through each element in the input list:
   - If the element is a number, push it onto the stack.
   - If the element is an operator (like +, -, *, /), pop the required number of operands from the stack (two for binary operators), perform the operation, and push the result back onto the stack.

3. **Handling Operations**: For each operator, you will need to define how to perform the corresponding arithmetic operation. Be sure to handle division carefully to avoid division by zero errors.

4. **Final Result**: After processing all elements in the list, the final result of the expression will be the only element left in the stack.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def evaluate_postfix(expression):
    stack = []
    
    for token in expression:
        if token.isdigit():  # Check if the token is a number
            stack.append(int(token))  # Push number onto the stack
        else:  # The token is an operator
            b = stack.pop()  # Pop the top two elements
            a = stack.pop()
            if token == '+':
                result = a + b
            elif token == '-':
                result = a - b
            elif token == '*':
                result = a * b
            elif token == '/':
                result = a / b  # Handle division
            stack.append(result)  # Push the result back onto the stack
    
    return stack.pop()  # The final result is the last element in the stack
```

This function will evaluate a given postfix expression represented as a list of strings and return the computed result. Make sure to handle edge cases, such as invalid input or division by zero, as needed.


[Critique]
The issue is caused by rounding the result of each operation to 10 decimal places before pushing it back onto the stack. This rounding should not be done on intermediate results, as it can cause the final result to be inaccurate. To fix this, remove the rounding when pushing the result back onto the stack and only round the final result if necessary.


INFO - [Task id] 22 [generation text] Explain: The critique correctly identifies the issue with rounding intermediate results. Rounding should only be applied to the final result if needed, as rounding intermediate results can lead to inaccuracies due to the cumulative effect of rounding errors.

Plan:
1) Remove the rounding of intermediate results.
2) Perform the arithmetic operations as before without rounding.
3) Return the final result from the stack without rounding, as the test cases expect the result to be a float with the precision Python naturally provides.

Code:
```python
def evaluate_postfix(expression):
    stack = []
    for token in expression:
        if token.lstrip('-').replace('.', '', 1).isdigit():
            stack.append(float(token))
        else:
            b = stack.pop()
            a = stack.pop()
            if token == '+':
                result = a + b
            elif token == '-':
                result = a - b
            elif token == '*':
                result = a * b
            elif token == '/':
                if b == 0:
                    raise ValueError('Division by zero is not allowed.')
                result = a / b
            stack.append(result)
    return stack.pop()
```

You are a Python programming assistant that assesses my progress of Python programming and provides useful guidance.

I will give you the following information:

[Task]: The objective I need to accomplish.
[Context]: The context of the task. Serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help me on the task, but my priority is to follow instructions in the Task tag.
[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)
