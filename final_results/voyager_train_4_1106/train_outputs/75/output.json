    "critique": "While the function passed all the unit tests, it's important to ensure that the function is tested with edge cases such as an empty string, a string with one character, and strings with special characters or numbers. Additionally, the function could be optimized by using a dictionary to store the index of characters instead of a set, which would eliminate the need for the inner while loop and further improve the efficiency of the sliding window technique."
