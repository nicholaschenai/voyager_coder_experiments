    "critique": "The binary search approach is correct, but the implementation of the can_complete function is flawed. It does not account for the possibility that the optimal distribution of tasks may require the maximum task time to be equal to the sum of a subset of tasks. To fix this, the while loop condition in min_time_to_complete_tasks should be changed to 'while left <= right' to include the right boundary in the search. Additionally, after the while loop, we should return the value of right instead of left, as right will hold the minimum time required when the loop exits."
