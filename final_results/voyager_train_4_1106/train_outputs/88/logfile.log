You are a helpful assistant that asks questions to help me decide the next immediate task to do for Python programming.
My ultimate goal is to solve as many diverse problems as possible and become the best programmer in the world.

I will give you the following information:
Completed tasks so far: ...
Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should ask at least 5 questions (but no more than 10 questions) to help me decide the next immediate task to do. Each question should be followed by the concept that the question is about.
2) Your question should be specific to a concept in Python programming.
  Bad example (the question is too general):
    Question: What is the best way to program in Python?
    Concept: unknown
  Good example:
    Question: How do you reverse a list?
    Concept: list
3) Your questions should be self-contained and not require any context.

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:

You are a helpful assistant that answer my question about Python programming.

I will give you the following information:
Question: ...

You will answer the question based on the context (only if available and helpful) and your own knowledge of Python programming.
1) Start your answer with "Answer: ".
2) Answer "Answer: Unknown" if you don't know the answer.

INFO - [Task id] 88 [prompt] Question: How do you use the itertools module to generate permutations of a list?
INFO - [Task id] 88 [generation text] Answer: You can use the `itertools.permutations` function from the `itertools` module to generate all possible permutations of a list in Python. Here’s how you can do it:

```python
import itertools

# Example list
my_list = [1, 2, 3]

# Generate permutations
permutations = itertools.permutations(my_list)

# Convert to a list and print
permuted_list = list(permutations)
print(permuted_list)
```

This will output all the permutations of the list `[1, 2, 3]`, which are:

```
[(1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2), (3, 2, 1)]
```

You can also specify the length of the permutations by passing a second argument to `itertools.permutations`. For example, `itertools.permutations(my_list, 2)` will generate all 2-length permutations of the list.

Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. As a rule of thumb, guide me through beginner problems, followed by interview level problems, followed by competitive programming problems. The latter 2 levels can involve concepts from data structures and algorithms.
2) Please be very specific about what skills I need to learn.
3) Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for problems which I have not solved yet. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) The task should involve writing a main Python function that at most use basic libraries (try not to import too many or too advanced modules)
7) Do not give tasks that require file operations (create, read, update, delete) or an internet connection.
8) I am only allowed to write Python functions, so do not require me to write other things (e.g. objects). 
9) Requiring me to write a function that takes in an object and uses object methods is still ok, but I cannot define the objects myself. You must provide the objects as input to my function in the assert statement.

Take note of these in your response:
1) Give an expected function name for the task.
2) Give a tuple of 3 assert statements that tests the function's correctness in the "test_tuple" field. This must strictly contain single-line assert statements only; any setup code for the test must be filled in the "test_setup_code" field.
3) The function name which you gave must be called in the assert statements. 

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}

INFO - [Task id] 88 [prompt] Question 1: How do you implement a binary search algorithm in Python?
Answer: To implement a binary search algorithm in Python, you can use either an iterative or a recursive approach. Below are examples of both methods.

### Iterative Approach

```python
def binary_search_iterative(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To avoid overflow
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Target found
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1  # Search in the right half
        else:
            right = mid - 1  # Search in the left half
            
    return -1  # Target not found
```

### Recursive Approach

```python
def binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, right):
    if left > right:
        return -1  # Target not found
    
    mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To avoid overflow
    
    if arr[mid] == target:
        return mid  # Target found
    elif arr[mid] < target:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, mid + 1, right)  # Search in the right half
    else:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, mid - 1)  # Search in the left half

# To use the recursive function, call it like this:
# result = binary_search_recursive(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
```

### Usage Example

```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
target = 5

# Using iterative approach
result_iterative = binary_search_iterative(arr, target)
print("Iterative result:", result_iterative)

# Using recursive approach
result_recursive = binary_search_recursive(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
print("Recursive result:", result_recursive)
```

Make sure the array is sorted before performing a binary search, as the algorithm assumes a sorted input.

Question 2: How can you find the longest common prefix among a list of strings?
Answer: To find the longest common prefix among a list of strings in Python, you can use the following approach:

1. Check if the list is empty. If it is, return an empty string.
2. Take the first string as a reference and compare it with the other strings.
3. Iterate through the characters of the reference string and check if they match with the corresponding characters of the other strings.
4. Stop when a mismatch is found or when you reach the end of the reference string.

Here is a sample implementation:

```python
def longest_common_prefix(strs):
    if not strs:
        return ""
    
    # Take the first string as the reference
    prefix = strs[0]
    
    for string in strs[1:]:
        # Compare the prefix with each string
        while string[:len(prefix)] != prefix and prefix:
            # Shorten the prefix
            prefix = prefix[:-1]
    
    return prefix

# Example usage
strings = ["flower", "flow", "flight"]
print(longest_common_prefix(strings))  # Output: "fl"
```

This function will return the longest common prefix among the provided list of strings.

Question 3: How do you implement a stack using a list in Python?
Answer: You can implement a stack using a list in Python by utilizing the list's built-in methods. A stack follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Here’s a simple implementation:

```python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.items) == 0

    def push(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)

    def pop(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items.pop()
        else:
            raise IndexError("pop from empty stack")

    def peek(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items[-1]
        else:
            raise IndexError("peek from empty stack")

    def size(self):
        return len(self.items)

# Example usage:
stack = Stack()
stack.push(1)
stack.push(2)
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 2
print(stack.peek())  # Output: 1
print(stack.size())  # Output: 1
```

In this implementation:
- `push(item)` adds an item to the top of the stack.
- `pop()` removes and returns the top item of the stack.
- `peek()` returns the top item without removing it.
- `is_empty()` checks if the stack is empty.
- `size()` returns the number of items in the stack.

Question 4: What is the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy in Python?
Answer: A shallow copy and a deep copy in Python differ in how they handle the copying of objects, particularly when those objects contain references to other objects.

- **Shallow Copy**: A shallow copy creates a new object, but it does not create copies of the objects that are referenced by the original object. Instead, it copies the references to those objects. This means that if the original object contains mutable objects (like lists or dictionaries), changes made to those mutable objects in the shallow copy will also reflect in the original object, and vice versa. You can create a shallow copy using the `copy` module's `copy()` function or by using the `list()` constructor for lists.

  Example:
  ```python
  import copy

  original = [1, 2, [3, 4]]
  shallow_copied = copy.copy(original)

  shallow_copied[2][0] = 'changed'
  print(original)  # Output: [1, 2, ['changed', 4]]
  ```

- **Deep Copy**: A deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all objects found in the original object, meaning that it creates copies of all nested objects as well. This ensures that the new object is completely independent of the original object. You can create a deep copy using the `copy` module's `deepcopy()` function.

  Example:
  ```python
  import copy

  original = [1, 2, [3, 4]]
  deep_copied = copy.deepcopy(original)

  deep_copied[2][0] = 'changed'
  print(original)  # Output: [1, 2, [3, 4]]
  ```

In summary, use a shallow copy when you want to copy the outer object but share references to the inner objects, and use a deep copy when you want to create a completely independent copy of the entire object structure.

Question 5: How do you use the itertools module to generate permutations of a list?
Answer: You can use the `itertools.permutations` function from the `itertools` module to generate all possible permutations of a list in Python. Here’s how you can do it:

```python
import itertools

# Example list
my_list = [1, 2, 3]

# Generate permutations
permutations = itertools.permutations(my_list)

# Convert to a list and print
permuted_list = list(permutations)
print(permuted_list)
```

This will output all the permutations of the list `[1, 2, 3]`, which are:

```
[(1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2), (3, 2, 1)]
```

You can also specify the length of the permutations by passing a second argument to `itertools.permutations`. For example, `itertools.permutations(my_list, 2)` will generate all 2-length permutations of the list.

Here’s a conceptual breakdown of the approach:

1. **Initialize Two Pointers**: Start with two pointers, `slow` and `fast`. Both pointers will initially point to the head of the linked list.

2. **Traverse the List**: Move through the linked list using a loop. In each iteration:
   - Move the `slow` pointer one step forward (i.e., `slow = slow.next`).
   - Move the `fast` pointer two steps forward (i.e., `fast = fast.next.next`).

3. **Determine the Middle Node**: The loop continues until the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list (i.e., `fast` becomes `None` or `fast.next` becomes `None`). At this point, the `slow` pointer will be at the middle node of the list. If the list has an even number of nodes, the `slow` pointer will end up at the second of the two middle nodes, which is the desired behavior.

4. **Return the Middle Node**: Finally, return the node that the `slow` pointer is currently pointing to.

This method ensures that you only traverse the list once and do not use any extra space, as required.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic in Python:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, value=0, next=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next

def find_middle_node(head):
    slow = head
    fast = head
    
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
    
    return slow
```

In this implementation, `ListNode` is a class representing a node in the linked list, and `find_middle_node` is the function that returns the middle node.

[Task]
Write a Python function that takes the head node of a singly linked list and returns the middle node. If the list has an even number of nodes, return the second of the two middle nodes. The function should not use any extra space, and it should complete in a single pass through the list.
You must strictly follow the function name: find_middle_node

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the middle node of a singly linked list in Python, you can use the "two-pointer" technique, which involves using two pointers that traverse the list at different speeds.

Here’s a conceptual breakdown of the approach:

1. **Initialize Two Pointers**: Start with two pointers, `slow` and `fast`. Both pointers will initially point to the head of the linked list.

2. **Traverse the List**: Move through the linked list using a loop. In each iteration:
   - Move the `slow` pointer one step forward (i.e., `slow = slow.next`).
   - Move the `fast` pointer two steps forward (i.e., `fast = fast.next.next`).

3. **Determine the Middle Node**: The loop continues until the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list (i.e., `fast` becomes `None` or `fast.next` becomes `None`). At this point, the `slow` pointer will be at the middle node of the list. If the list has an even number of nodes, the `slow` pointer will end up at the second of the two middle nodes, which is the desired behavior.

4. **Return the Middle Node**: Finally, return the node that the `slow` pointer is currently pointing to.

This method ensures that you only traverse the list once and do not use any extra space, as required.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic in Python:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, value=0, next=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next

def find_middle_node(head):
    slow = head
    fast = head
    
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
    
    return slow
```

In this implementation, `ListNode` is a class representing a node in the linked list, and `find_middle_node` is the function that returns the middle node.

[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)
