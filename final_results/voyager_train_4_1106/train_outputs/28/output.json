    "critique": "While the function passes the provided tests, it's important to ensure that it handles larger values of n efficiently. If performance issues arise for larger n, consider optimizing the string concatenation process, as it can be costly in Python. Additionally, adding more test cases, especially for edge cases such as n=0 and very large values of n, would help ensure the robustness of the function."
