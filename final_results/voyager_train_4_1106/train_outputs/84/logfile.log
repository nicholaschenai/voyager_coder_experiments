You are a helpful assistant that asks questions to help me decide the next immediate task to do for Python programming.
My ultimate goal is to solve as many diverse problems as possible and become the best programmer in the world.

I will give you the following information:
Completed tasks so far: ...
Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should ask at least 5 questions (but no more than 10 questions) to help me decide the next immediate task to do. Each question should be followed by the concept that the question is about.
2) Your question should be specific to a concept in Python programming.
  Bad example (the question is too general):
    Question: What is the best way to program in Python?
    Concept: unknown
  Good example:
    Question: How do you reverse a list?
    Concept: list
3) Your questions should be self-contained and not require any context.

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

You are a helpful assistant that answer my question about Python programming.

Question: ...

You will answer the question based on the context (only if available and helpful) and your own knowledge of Python programming.
1) Start your answer with "Answer: ".
2) Answer "Answer: Unknown" if you don't know the answer.

INFO - [Task id] 84 [prompt] Question: How can you use dynamic programming to solve the coin change problem?
INFO - [Task id] 84 [generation text] Answer: To solve the coin change problem using dynamic programming, you can follow these steps:

1. **Define the Problem**: The coin change problem involves finding the minimum number of coins needed to make a certain amount of money using a given set of coin denominations.

2. **Create a DP Array**: Initialize a list (or array) `dp` where `dp[i]` will represent the minimum number of coins needed to make the amount `i`. The size of this array should be `amount + 1`, initialized with a value greater than any possible number of coins (e.g., `float('inf')`), except for `dp[0]`, which should be `0` since no coins are needed to make the amount `0`.

3. **Fill the DP Array**: Iterate through each coin in the list of denominations. For each coin, update the `dp` array for all amounts from the coin's value up to the target amount. For each amount `i`, you can update `dp[i]` as follows:
   ```python
   dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
   ```
   This means that if you can make the amount `i - coin`, then you can make amount `i` by adding one more coin.

4. **Result**: After processing all coins, the value at `dp[amount]` will give you the minimum number of coins needed to make that amount. If `dp[amount]` is still `float('inf')`, it means that it is not possible to make that amount with the given coins.

Here is a sample implementation in Python:

```python
def coin_change(coins, amount):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0  # Base case: 0 coins needed to make amount 0

    for coin in coins:
        for i in range(coin, amount + 1):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)

    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1  # Return -1 if amount cannot be made
```

In this implementation, `coins` is the list of coin denominations, and `amount` is the target amount you want to make. The function returns the minimum number of coins needed or `-1` if it's not possible to make that amount.

1) Start your answer with "Answer: ".
2) Answer "Answer: Unknown" if you don't know the answer.

INFO - [Task id] 84 [prompt] Question: What is the approach to find the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm?
INFO - [Task id] 84 [generation text] Answer: The approach to find the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm involves the following steps:

1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing two variables: `max_current` and `max_global`. Set both of them to the first element of the array. `max_current` will keep track of the maximum sum of the subarray that ends at the current position, while `max_global` will store the overall maximum found so far.

2. **Iterate through the array**: Loop through the array starting from the second element. For each element, update `max_current` to be the maximum of the current element itself or the sum of `max_current` and the current element. This step decides whether to start a new subarray at the current element or to continue the existing subarray.

   ```python
   max_current = max_global = array[0]
   for i in range(1, len(array)):
       max_current = max(array[i], max_current + array[i])
       if max_current > max_global:
           max_global = max_current
   ```

3. **Update the global maximum**: After updating `max_current`, check if it is greater than `max_global`. If it is, update `max_global` with the value of `max_current`.

4. **Result**: After iterating through the entire array, `max_global` will contain the maximum subarray sum.

This algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity, making it efficient for this problem.

INFO - [Task id] 84 [prompt] Question: How do you check if a string contains all unique characters without using additional data structures?
INFO - [Task id] 84 [generation text] Answer: You can check if a string contains all unique characters without using additional data structures by using a nested loop to compare each character with every other character in the string. Here's a simple implementation:

```python
def has_all_unique_characters(s):
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(s)):
            if s[i] == s[j]:
                return False
    return True

# Example usage
string = "abcdef"
print(has_all_unique_characters(string))  # Output: True

string = "abcdea"
print(has_all_unique_characters(string))  # Output: False
```

In this code, the outer loop iterates through each character, and the inner loop checks for duplicates by comparing the current character with all subsequent characters. If a duplicate is found, the function returns `False`. If no duplicates are found after all comparisons, it returns `True`.

Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. As a rule of thumb, guide me through beginner problems, followed by interview level problems, followed by competitive programming problems. The latter 2 levels can involve concepts from data structures and algorithms.
2) Please be very specific about what skills I need to learn.
3) Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for problems which I have not solved yet. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) The task should involve writing a main Python function that at most use basic libraries (try not to import too many or too advanced modules)
7) Do not give tasks that require file operations (create, read, update, delete) or an internet connection.
8) I am only allowed to write Python functions, so do not require me to write other things (e.g. objects). 
9) Requiring me to write a function that takes in an object and uses object methods is still ok, but I cannot define the objects myself. You must provide the objects as input to my function in the assert statement.

1) Give an expected function name for the task.
2) Give a tuple of 3 assert statements that tests the function's correctness in the "test_tuple" field. This must strictly contain single-line assert statements only; any setup code for the test must be filled in the "test_setup_code" field.
3) The function name which you gave must be called in the assert statements. 

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.

INFO - [Task id] 84 [prompt] Question 1: How do you implement a binary search algorithm in Python?
Answer: To implement a binary search algorithm in Python, you can use either an iterative or a recursive approach. Below are examples of both methods.

### Iterative Approach

```python
def binary_search_iterative(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To avoid overflow
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Target found
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1  # Search in the right half
        else:
            right = mid - 1  # Search in the left half
            
    return -1  # Target not found
```

### Recursive Approach

```python
def binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, right):
    if left > right:
        return -1  # Target not found
    
    mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To avoid overflow
    
    if arr[mid] == target:
        return mid  # Target found
    elif arr[mid] < target:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, mid + 1, right)  # Search in the right half
    else:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, mid - 1)  # Search in the left half

# To use the recursive function, call it like this:
# result = binary_search_recursive(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
```

### Usage Example

```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
target = 5

# Using iterative approach
result_iterative = binary_search_iterative(arr, target)
print("Iterative result:", result_iterative)

# Using recursive approach
result_recursive = binary_search_recursive(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
print("Recursive result:", result_recursive)
```

Make sure the array is sorted before performing a binary search, as the algorithm assumes a sorted input.

Question 2: How can you find the longest common prefix among a list of strings?
Answer: To find the longest common prefix among a list of strings in Python, you can use the following approach:

1. Check if the list is empty. If it is, return an empty string.
2. Take the first string as a reference and compare it with the other strings.
3. Iterate through the characters of the reference string and check if they match with the corresponding characters of the other strings.
4. Stop when a mismatch is found or when you reach the end of the reference string.

Here is a sample implementation:

```python
def longest_common_prefix(strs):
    if not strs:
        return ""
    
    # Take the first string as the reference
    prefix = strs[0]
    
    for string in strs[1:]:
        # Compare the prefix with each string
        while string[:len(prefix)] != prefix and prefix:
            # Shorten the prefix
            prefix = prefix[:-1]
    
    return prefix

# Example usage
strings = ["flower", "flow", "flight"]
print(longest_common_prefix(strings))  # Output: "fl"
```

This function will return the longest common prefix among the provided list of strings.

Question 3: How can you use dynamic programming to solve the coin change problem?
Answer: To solve the coin change problem using dynamic programming, you can follow these steps:

1. **Define the Problem**: The coin change problem involves finding the minimum number of coins needed to make a certain amount of money using a given set of coin denominations.

2. **Create a DP Array**: Initialize a list (or array) `dp` where `dp[i]` will represent the minimum number of coins needed to make the amount `i`. The size of this array should be `amount + 1`, initialized with a value greater than any possible number of coins (e.g., `float('inf')`), except for `dp[0]`, which should be `0` since no coins are needed to make the amount `0`.

3. **Fill the DP Array**: Iterate through each coin in the list of denominations. For each coin, update the `dp` array for all amounts from the coin's value up to the target amount. For each amount `i`, you can update `dp[i]` as follows:
   ```python
   dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
   ```
   This means that if you can make the amount `i - coin`, then you can make amount `i` by adding one more coin.

4. **Result**: After processing all coins, the value at `dp[amount]` will give you the minimum number of coins needed to make that amount. If `dp[amount]` is still `float('inf')`, it means that it is not possible to make that amount with the given coins.

Here is a sample implementation in Python:

```python
def coin_change(coins, amount):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0  # Base case: 0 coins needed to make amount 0

    for coin in coins:
        for i in range(coin, amount + 1):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)

    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1  # Return -1 if amount cannot be made
```

In this implementation, `coins` is the list of coin denominations, and `amount` is the target amount you want to make. The function returns the minimum number of coins needed or `-1` if it's not possible to make that amount.

Question 4: What is the approach to find the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm?
Answer: The approach to find the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm involves the following steps:

1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing two variables: `max_current` and `max_global`. Set both of them to the first element of the array. `max_current` will keep track of the maximum sum of the subarray that ends at the current position, while `max_global` will store the overall maximum found so far.

2. **Iterate through the array**: Loop through the array starting from the second element. For each element, update `max_current` to be the maximum of the current element itself or the sum of `max_current` and the current element. This step decides whether to start a new subarray at the current element or to continue the existing subarray.

   ```python
   max_current = max_global = array[0]
   for i in range(1, len(array)):
       max_current = max(array[i], max_current + array[i])
       if max_current > max_global:
           max_global = max_current
   ```

3. **Update the global maximum**: After updating `max_current`, check if it is greater than `max_global`. If it is, update `max_global` with the value of `max_current`.

4. **Result**: After iterating through the entire array, `max_global` will contain the maximum subarray sum.

This algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity, making it efficient for this problem.

Question 5: How do you check if a string contains all unique characters without using additional data structures?
Answer: You can check if a string contains all unique characters without using additional data structures by using a nested loop to compare each character with every other character in the string. Here's a simple implementation:

```python
def has_all_unique_characters(s):
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(s)):
            if s[i] == s[j]:
                return False
    return True

# Example usage
string = "abcdef"
print(has_all_unique_characters(string))  # Output: True

string = "abcdea"
print(has_all_unique_characters(string))  # Output: False
```

In this code, the outer loop iterates through each character, and the inner loop checks for duplicates by comparing the current character with all subsequent characters. If a duplicate is found, the function returns `False`. If no duplicates are found after all comparisons, it returns `True`.

INFO - [Task id] 84 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
Write a Python function that takes a graph represented as a dictionary where keys are node labels and values are lists of tuples representing adjacent nodes and their respective distances, along with a start node label. The function should return a dictionary with the shortest distance from the start node to each other node in the graph using Dijkstra's algorithm. If a node is unreachable from the start node, it should not be included in the returned dictionary.
INFO - [Task id] 84 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of implementing Dijkstra's algorithm in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Initialize Data Structures**:
   - Create a dictionary to store the shortest distances from the start node to each node, initializing the distance to the start node as 0 and all other nodes as infinity (or a very large number).
   - Use a priority queue (often implemented with a heap) to efficiently retrieve the next node with the smallest distance.

2. **Set Up the Priority Queue**:
   - Start by adding the start node to the priority queue with a distance of 0.

3. **Process Nodes**:
   - While the priority queue is not empty, extract the node with the smallest distance.
   - For each adjacent node of the current node, calculate the potential new distance by adding the current node's distance to the edge weight (distance to the adjacent node).
   - If this new distance is less than the previously recorded distance for the adjacent node, update the distance and add the adjacent node to the priority queue.

4. **Handle Unreachable Nodes**:
   - After processing all reachable nodes, filter the distance dictionary to exclude any nodes that still have the initial value of infinity, as these nodes are unreachable from the start node.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, return the dictionary containing the shortest distances from the start node to all reachable nodes.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    # Initialize distances and priority queue
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    priority_queue = [(0, start)]  # (distance, node)

    while priority_queue:
        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)

        # If the distance is greater than the recorded distance, skip
        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:
            continue

        # Explore neighbors
        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node]:
            distance = current_distance + weight

            # Only consider this new path if it's better
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (distance, neighbor))

    # Filter out unreachable nodes
    return {node: dist for node, dist in distances.items() if dist < float('inf')}
```

This function effectively implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from a starting node to all other reachable nodes in a graph represented as a dictionary.

[Task]
Write a Python function that takes a graph represented as a dictionary where keys are node labels and values are lists of tuples representing adjacent nodes and their respective distances, along with a start node label. The function should return a dictionary with the shortest distance from the start node to each other node in the graph using Dijkstra's algorithm. If a node is unreachable from the start node, it should not be included in the returned dictionary.

RESPONSE:
{
    "reason": "The implementation failed 4 out of the 7 test cases due to an IndexError.",
    "success": false,
    "critique": "The issue stems from the while loop while current_sum + nums[right] <= target:, which directly accesses nums[right] without checking if right is within the bounds of the list. This results in a runtime error when right goes beyond the list length. To overcome this error, we need to add a bounds check for the right variable in the mentioned while loop. We can modify the loop condition to while right < len(nums) and current_sum + nums[right] <= target:. This change will ensure that we only access elements within the bounds of the list, thus avoiding the IndexError."

INFO - [Task id] 84 [prompt] [Task]:
Write a Python function that takes a graph represented as a dictionary where keys are node labels and values are lists of tuples representing adjacent nodes and their respective distances, along with a start node label. The function should return a dictionary with the shortest distance from the start node to each other node in the graph using Dijkstra's algorithm. If a node is unreachable from the start node, it should not be included in the returned dictionary.
[Context]: 
 Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of implementing Dijkstra's algorithm in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Initialize Data Structures**:
   - Create a dictionary to store the shortest distances from the start node to each node, initializing the distance to the start node as 0 and all other nodes as infinity (or a very large number).
   - Use a priority queue (often implemented with a heap) to efficiently retrieve the next node with the smallest distance.

2. **Set Up the Priority Queue**:
   - Start by adding the start node to the priority queue with a distance of 0.

3. **Process Nodes**:
   - While the priority queue is not empty, extract the node with the smallest distance.
   - For each adjacent node of the current node, calculate the potential new distance by adding the current node's distance to the edge weight (distance to the adjacent node).
   - If this new distance is less than the previously recorded distance for the adjacent node, update the distance and add the adjacent node to the priority queue.

4. **Handle Unreachable Nodes**:
   - After processing all reachable nodes, filter the distance dictionary to exclude any nodes that still have the initial value of infinity, as these nodes are unreachable from the start node.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, return the dictionary containing the shortest distances from the start node to all reachable nodes.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    # Initialize distances and priority queue
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    priority_queue = [(0, start)]  # (distance, node)

    while priority_queue:
        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)

        # If the distance is greater than the recorded distance, skip
        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:
            continue

        # Explore neighbors
        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node]:
            distance = current_distance + weight

            # Only consider this new path if it's better
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (distance, neighbor))

    # Filter out unreachable nodes
    return {node: dist for node, dist in distances.items() if dist < float('inf')}
```

This function effectively implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from a starting node to all other reachable nodes in a graph represented as a dictionary.

The main function is `dijkstra_shortest_path`.
INFO - [Task id] 84 [generation text] This function implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in a weighted graph. It initializes distances to all nodes as infinity, except for the starting node, which is set to zero. A priority queue is used to explore the graph, processing nodes in order of their current known distance. For each node, it updates the distances to its neighbors if a shorter path is found. The function continues until all reachable nodes have been processed. Finally, it returns a dictionary of nodes with their corresponding shortest distances, excluding those that are unreachable.
