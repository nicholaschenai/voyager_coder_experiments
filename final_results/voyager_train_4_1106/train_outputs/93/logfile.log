You are a helpful assistant that asks questions to help me decide the next immediate task to do for Python programming.
My ultimate goal is to solve as many diverse problems as possible and become the best programmer in the world.

I will give you the following information:
Completed tasks so far: ...
Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should ask at least 5 questions (but no more than 10 questions) to help me decide the next immediate task to do. Each question should be followed by the concept that the question is about.
2) Your question should be specific to a concept in Python programming.
  Bad example (the question is too general):
    Question: What is the best way to program in Python?
    Concept: unknown
  Good example:
    Question: How do you reverse a list?
    Concept: list
3) Your questions should be self-contained and not require any context.

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:

The 'look-and-say' sequence starts with '1' and each subsequent term is derived by describing the previous term. For example, the term after '1' is '11' (one 1), after '11' is '21' (two 1s), after '21' is '1211' (one 2, then one 1), and so on. The function should handle n being a positive integer greater than 0.

This is a classic dynamic programming problem where you need to find the least number of perfect square numbers which sum to `n`. For example, given `n = 12`, the answer should be `3` because `12 = 4 + 4 + 4`.
	Write a Python function that takes a string and returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. The function should use the sliding window technique to efficiently solve the problem.

You are a helpful assistant that tells me the next immediate task (in the form of a function) to do for Python programming.

Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. As a rule of thumb, guide me through beginner problems, followed by interview level problems, followed by competitive programming problems. The latter 2 levels can involve concepts from data structures and algorithms.
2) Please be very specific about what skills I need to learn.
3) Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for problems which I have not solved yet. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) The task should involve writing a main Python function that at most use basic libraries (try not to import too many or too advanced modules)
7) Do not give tasks that require file operations (create, read, update, delete) or an internet connection.
8) I am only allowed to write Python functions, so do not require me to write other things (e.g. objects). 
9) Requiring me to write a function that takes in an object and uses object methods is still ok, but I cannot define the objects myself. You must provide the objects as input to my function in the assert statement.

Take note of these in your response:
1) Give an expected function name for the task.
2) Give a tuple of 3 assert statements that tests the function's correctness in the "test_tuple" field. This must strictly contain single-line assert statements only; any setup code for the test must be filled in the "test_setup_code" field.
3) The function name which you gave must be called in the assert statements. 

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}

INFO - [Task id] 93 [prompt] Question 1: How do you implement a binary search algorithm in Python?
Answer: To implement a binary search algorithm in Python, you can use either an iterative or a recursive approach. Below are examples of both methods.

### Iterative Approach

```python
def binary_search_iterative(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To avoid overflow
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Target found
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1  # Search in the right half
        else:
            right = mid - 1  # Search in the left half
            
    return -1  # Target not found
```

### Recursive Approach

```python
def binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, right):
    if left > right:
        return -1  # Target not found
    
    mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To avoid overflow
    
    if arr[mid] == target:
        return mid  # Target found
    elif arr[mid] < target:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, mid + 1, right)  # Search in the right half
    else:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, mid - 1)  # Search in the left half

# To use the recursive function, call it like this:
# result = binary_search_recursive(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
```

### Usage Example

```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
target = 5

# Using iterative approach
result_iterative = binary_search_iterative(arr, target)
print("Iterative result:", result_iterative)

# Using recursive approach
result_recursive = binary_search_recursive(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
print("Recursive result:", result_recursive)
```

Make sure the array is sorted before performing a binary search, as the algorithm assumes a sorted input.

Question 2: What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?
Answer: The main differences between a list and a tuple in Python are:

1. **Mutability**: Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their content (add, remove, or modify elements) after they are created. Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable, which means once a tuple is created, you cannot change its content.

2. **Syntax**: Lists are defined using square brackets `[]`, while tuples are defined using parentheses `()`.

3. **Performance**: Tuples can be slightly more memory-efficient and faster than lists for certain operations because of their immutability.

4. **Use Cases**: Lists are generally used for collections of items that may need to be modified, while tuples are often used for fixed collections of items, such as coordinates or records.

Example:
```python
# List
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)  # This is allowed

# Tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
# my_tuple.append(4)  # This would raise an AttributeError
```

In summary, use lists when you need a mutable sequence and tuples when you need an immutable sequence.

Question 3: How can you use list comprehensions to create a new list in Python?
Answer: You can use list comprehensions in Python to create a new list by applying an expression to each item in an existing iterable (like a list or a range) and optionally filtering items based on a condition. The syntax for a list comprehension is:

```python
new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition]
```

Here’s a simple example:

```python
# Create a list of squares of even numbers from 0 to 9
squares_of_evens = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
print(squares_of_evens)  # Output: [0, 4, 16, 36, 64]
```

In this example, `x**2` is the expression, `x` is the item from the iterable `range(10)`, and `if x % 2 == 0` is the condition that filters the items.

Question 4: What is the purpose of the 'with' statement in Python, and how does it relate to file handling?
Answer: The 'with' statement in Python is used to wrap the execution of a block of code within methods defined by a context manager. The primary purpose of the 'with' statement is to ensure that resources are properly managed, particularly when dealing with operations that require setup and teardown, such as file handling.

When it comes to file handling, using the 'with' statement simplifies the process of opening and closing files. It automatically takes care of closing the file once the block of code is exited, even if an error occurs within the block. This helps prevent resource leaks and makes the code cleaner and more readable.

Here’s an example of using the 'with' statement for file handling:

```python
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

In this example, the file 'example.txt' is opened for reading, and the file object is assigned to the variable `file`. Once the block of code is executed, the file is automatically closed, so there is no need to explicitly call `file.close()`. This is particularly useful for managing file resources efficiently.

Question 5: How do you create a class in Python and instantiate an object from it?
Answer: To create a class in Python, you use the `class` keyword followed by the class name and a colon. Inside the class, you can define methods and attributes. To instantiate an object from the class, you simply call the class as if it were a function.

Here is an example:

```python
# Define a class
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # Instance variable for the dog's name
        self.age = age    # Instance variable for the dog's age

    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"

# Instantiate an object from the class
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)

# Accessing attributes and methods
print(my_dog.name)  # Output: Buddy
print(my_dog.age)   # Output: 3
print(my_dog.bark())  # Output: Buddy says woof!
```

In this example, we created a class `Dog` with an initializer method `__init__` to set the name and age of the dog. We then created an instance of `Dog` called `my_dog` and accessed its attributes and methods.

INFO - [Task id] 93 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
Write a Python function that takes the root node of a binary tree and returns True if it is a valid binary search tree (BST), and False otherwise. A valid BST is one where for every node, the values of all the nodes in its left subtree are less than its value, and the values of all the nodes in its right subtree are greater than its value.
INFO - [Task id] 93 [generation text] Answer: To determine if a binary tree is a valid binary search tree (BST), you can use a recursive approach that checks the properties of the BST for each node. Here’s a conceptual outline of how to accomplish this:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function that takes the root node of the binary tree as an argument.

2. **Recursive Helper Function**: Inside your main function, define a helper function that will take additional parameters to keep track of the valid range for the node values. This range will be defined by two values: `min_val` and `max_val`, which represent the lower and upper bounds for the current node's value.

3. **Base Case**: In the helper function, check if the current node is `None`. If it is, return `True` because an empty subtree is a valid BST.

4. **Value Check**: For the current node, check if its value is within the valid range defined by `min_val` and `max_val`. If it is not, return `False`.

5. **Recursive Calls**: Recursively call the helper function for the left child of the current node, updating the `max_val` to the current node's value (since all values in the left subtree must be less than the current node's value). For the right child, update the `min_val` to the current node's value (since all values in the right subtree must be greater).

6. **Combine Results**: Return the result of the recursive calls for both the left and right children. The tree is a valid BST if both subtrees are valid.

Here’s a simple pseudocode representation of the above logic:

```python
def is_valid_bst(root):
    def helper(node, min_val, max_val):
        if not node:
            return True
        if not (min_val < node.val < max_val):
            return False
        return (helper(node.left, min_val, node.val) and
                helper(node.right, node.val, max_val))
    
    return helper(root, float('-inf'), float('inf'))
```

In this pseudocode:
- `float('-inf')` and `float('inf')` are used to represent the initial bounds for the root node.
- The helper function checks each node against its allowed range and recursively validates the left and right subtrees.

By following this approach, you can effectively determine if a binary tree is a valid binary search tree.

[Task]
Write a Python function that takes the root node of a binary tree and returns True if it is a valid binary search tree (BST), and False otherwise. A valid BST is one where for every node, the values of all the nodes in its left subtree are less than its value, and the values of all the nodes in its right subtree are greater than its value.
You must strictly follow the function name: is_valid_bst

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To determine if a binary tree is a valid binary search tree (BST), you can use a recursive approach that checks the properties of the BST for each node. Here’s a conceptual outline of how to accomplish this:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function that takes the root node of the binary tree as an argument.

2. **Recursive Helper Function**: Inside your main function, define a helper function that will take additional parameters to keep track of the valid range for the node values. This range will be defined by two values: `min_val` and `max_val`, which represent the lower and upper bounds for the current node's value.

3. **Base Case**: In the helper function, check if the current node is `None`. If it is, return `True` because an empty subtree is a valid BST.

4. **Value Check**: For the current node, check if its value is within the valid range defined by `min_val` and `max_val`. If it is not, return `False`.

5. **Recursive Calls**: Recursively call the helper function for the left child of the current node, updating the `max_val` to the current node's value (since all values in the left subtree must be less than the current node's value). For the right child, update the `min_val` to the current node's value (since all values in the right subtree must be greater).

6. **Combine Results**: Return the result of the recursive calls for both the left and right children. The tree is a valid BST if both subtrees are valid.

Here’s a simple pseudocode representation of the above logic:

```python
def is_valid_bst(root):
    def helper(node, min_val, max_val):
        if not node:
            return True
        if not (min_val < node.val < max_val):
            return False
        return (helper(node.left, min_val, node.val) and
                helper(node.right, node.val, max_val))
    
    return helper(root, float('-inf'), float('inf'))
```

In this pseudocode:
- `float('-inf')` and `float('inf')` are used to represent the initial bounds for the root node.
- The helper function checks each node against its allowed range and recursively validates the left and right subtrees.

By following this approach, you can effectively determine if a binary tree is a valid binary search tree.

INFO - [Task id] 93 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a good outline for the task at hand. The plan is to create a recursive function that checks if a binary tree is a valid binary search tree (BST) by ensuring that all nodes in the left subtree are less than the current node's value and all nodes in the right subtree are greater than the current node's value.

Plan:
1) Define the function `is_valid_bst` with a single parameter `root` which represents the root node of the binary tree.
2) Inside the `is_valid_bst` function, define a nested helper function `is_valid_bst_helper` that takes three parameters: `node`, `min_val`, and `max_val`. This helper function will be used to recursively check the validity of the BST.
3) In the helper function, check if the current `node` is `None`. If it is, return `True` because a `None` node is considered a valid BST.
4) Check if the value of the current `node` is not within the range defined by `min_val` and `max_val`. If it's not, return `False`.
5) Recursively call the helper function for the left child of the current node with `max_val` updated to the current node's value. This ensures that all values in the left subtree are less than the current node's value.
6) Recursively call the helper function for the right child of the current node with `min_val` updated to the current node's value. This ensures that all values in the right subtree are greater than the current node's value.
7) Return `True` if both recursive calls for the left and right children return `True`, indicating that the subtree rooted at the current node is a valid BST.
8) Call the helper function with the `root` node and initial `min_val` and `max_val` as negative and positive infinity, respectively, and return its result.

Code:
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def is_valid_bst(root: TreeNode) -> bool:
    def is_valid_bst_helper(node, min_val, max_val):
        if not node:

    return is_valid_bst_helper(root, float('-inf'), float('inf'))
```

INFO - [Task id] 93 [prompt] [Task]:
Write a Python function that takes the root node of a binary tree and returns True if it is a valid binary search tree (BST), and False otherwise. A valid BST is one where for every node, the values of all the nodes in its left subtree are less than its value, and the values of all the nodes in its right subtree are greater than its value.
[Context]: 
 Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To determine if a binary tree is a valid binary search tree (BST), you can use a recursive approach that checks the properties of the BST for each node. Here’s a conceptual outline of how to accomplish this:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function that takes the root node of the binary tree as an argument.

2. **Recursive Helper Function**: Inside your main function, define a helper function that will take additional parameters to keep track of the valid range for the node values. This range will be defined by two values: `min_val` and `max_val`, which represent the lower and upper bounds for the current node's value.

3. **Base Case**: In the helper function, check if the current node is `None`. If it is, return `True` because an empty subtree is a valid BST.

4. **Value Check**: For the current node, check if its value is within the valid range defined by `min_val` and `max_val`. If it is not, return `False`.

5. **Recursive Calls**: Recursively call the helper function for the left child of the current node, updating the `max_val` to the current node's value (since all values in the left subtree must be less than the current node's value). For the right child, update the `min_val` to the current node's value (since all values in the right subtree must be greater).

6. **Combine Results**: Return the result of the recursive calls for both the left and right children. The tree is a valid BST if both subtrees are valid.

Here’s a simple pseudocode representation of the above logic:

```python
def is_valid_bst(root):
    def helper(node, min_val, max_val):
        if not node:
            return True
        if not (min_val < node.val < max_val):
            return False
        return (helper(node.left, min_val, node.val) and
                helper(node.right, node.val, max_val))
    
    return helper(root, float('-inf'), float('inf'))
```

In this pseudocode:
- `float('-inf')` and `float('inf')` are used to represent the initial bounds for the root node.
- The helper function checks each node against its allowed range and recursively validates the left and right subtrees.

By following this approach, you can effectively determine if a binary tree is a valid binary search tree.

    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests

[Task]
Write a Python function that takes the root node of a binary tree and returns True if it is a valid binary search tree (BST), and False otherwise. A valid BST is one where for every node, the values of all the nodes in its left subtree are less than its value, and the values of all the nodes in its right subtree are greater than its value.
You must strictly follow the function name: is_valid_bst

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To determine if a binary tree is a valid binary search tree (BST), you can use a recursive approach that checks the properties of the BST for each node. Here’s a conceptual outline of how to accomplish this:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function that takes the root node of the binary tree as an argument.

2. **Recursive Helper Function**: Inside your main function, define a helper function that will take additional parameters to keep track of the valid range for the node values. This range will be defined by two values: `min_val` and `max_val`, which represent the lower and upper bounds for the current node's value.

3. **Base Case**: In the helper function, check if the current node is `None`. If it is, return `True` because an empty subtree is a valid BST.

4. **Value Check**: For the current node, check if its value is within the valid range defined by `min_val` and `max_val`. If it is not, return `False`.

5. **Recursive Calls**: Recursively call the helper function for the left child of the current node, updating the `max_val` to the current node's value (since all values in the left subtree must be less than the current node's value). For the right child, update the `min_val` to the current node's value (since all values in the right subtree must be greater).

6. **Combine Results**: Return the result of the recursive calls for both the left and right children. The tree is a valid BST if both subtrees are valid.

Here’s a simple pseudocode representation of the above logic:

```python
def is_valid_bst(root):
    def helper(node, min_val, max_val):
        if not node:
            return True
        if not (min_val < node.val < max_val):
            return False
        return (helper(node.left, min_val, node.val) and
                helper(node.right, node.val, max_val))
    
    return helper(root, float('-inf'), float('inf'))
```

In this pseudocode:
- `float('-inf')` and `float('inf')` are used to represent the initial bounds for the root node.
- The helper function checks each node against its allowed range and recursively validates the left and right subtrees.

By following this approach, you can effectively determine if a binary tree is a valid binary search tree.


[Critique]
To fix the issue, ensure that the 'TreeNode' class is defined before it is used, or import it from a module where it is defined. The 'TreeNode' class should represent the structure of a node in a binary tree, typically with attributes for the value of the node and references to the left and right child nodes.


INFO - [Task id] 93 [generation text] Explain: The error message indicates that the `TreeNode` class is not defined in the environment where the `is_valid_bst` function is being tested. The `TreeNode` class is essential for creating the binary tree nodes that the `is_valid_bst` function expects as input.

Plan:
1) Define the `TreeNode` class with attributes for the value of the node and references to the left and right child nodes.
2) Implement the `is_valid_bst` function using the recursive helper function approach as described in the context.
3) The `is_valid_bst` function will use the `TreeNode` class for its input parameter type hint.

[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

[Task]
Write a Python function that takes the root node of a binary tree and returns True if it is a valid binary search tree (BST), and False otherwise. A valid BST is one where for every node, the values of all the nodes in its left subtree are less than its value, and the values of all the nodes in its right subtree are greater than its value.
You must strictly follow the function name: is_valid_bst

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To determine if a binary tree is a valid binary search tree (BST), you can use a recursive approach that checks the properties of the BST for each node. Here’s a conceptual outline of how to accomplish this:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function that takes the root node of the binary tree as an argument.

2. **Recursive Helper Function**: Inside your main function, define a helper function that will take additional parameters to keep track of the valid range for the node values. This range will be defined by two values: `min_val` and `max_val`, which represent the lower and upper bounds for the current node's value.

3. **Base Case**: In the helper function, check if the current node is `None`. If it is, return `True` because an empty subtree is a valid BST.

4. **Value Check**: For the current node, check if its value is within the valid range defined by `min_val` and `max_val`. If it is not, return `False`.

5. **Recursive Calls**: Recursively call the helper function for the left child of the current node, updating the `max_val` to the current node's value (since all values in the left subtree must be less than the current node's value). For the right child, update the `min_val` to the current node's value (since all values in the right subtree must be greater).

6. **Combine Results**: Return the result of the recursive calls for both the left and right children. The tree is a valid BST if both subtrees are valid.

Here’s a simple pseudocode representation of the above logic:

```python
def is_valid_bst(root):
    def helper(node, min_val, max_val):
        if not node:
            return True
        if not (min_val < node.val < max_val):
            return False
        return (helper(node.left, min_val, node.val) and
                helper(node.right, node.val, max_val))
    
    return helper(root, float('-inf'), float('inf'))
```

In this pseudocode:
- `float('-inf')` and `float('inf')` are used to represent the initial bounds for the root node.
- The helper function checks each node against its allowed range and recursively validates the left and right subtrees.

By following this approach, you can effectively determine if a binary tree is a valid binary search tree.


[Critique]
To fix the issue, ensure that the 'TreeNode' class is defined before it is used, or import it from a module where it is defined. The 'TreeNode' class should represent the structure of a node in a binary tree, typically with attributes for the value of the node and references to the left and right child nodes.


INFO - [Task id] 93 [generation text] Explain: The error message indicates that the `TreeNode` class is not defined in the environment where the `is_valid_bst` function is being tested. The `TreeNode` class is essential for creating the binary tree nodes that the `is_valid_bst` function expects as input.

Plan:
1) Define the `TreeNode` class with attributes for the value of the node and references to the left and right child nodes.
2) Implement the `is_valid_bst` function using the recursive helper function approach as described in the context.
3) The `is_valid_bst` function will use the `TreeNode` class for its input parameter type hint.

[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

[Task]
Write a Python function that takes the root node of a binary tree and returns True if it is a valid binary search tree (BST), and False otherwise. A valid BST is one where for every node, the values of all the nodes in its left subtree are less than its value, and the values of all the nodes in its right subtree are greater than its value.
You must strictly follow the function name: is_valid_bst

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To determine if a binary tree is a valid binary search tree (BST), you can use a recursive approach that checks the properties of the BST for each node. Here’s a conceptual outline of how to accomplish this:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function that takes the root node of the binary tree as an argument.

2. **Recursive Helper Function**: Inside your main function, define a helper function that will take additional parameters to keep track of the valid range for the node values. This range will be defined by two values: `min_val` and `max_val`, which represent the lower and upper bounds for the current node's value.

3. **Base Case**: In the helper function, check if the current node is `None`. If it is, return `True` because an empty subtree is a valid BST.

4. **Value Check**: For the current node, check if its value is within the valid range defined by `min_val` and `max_val`. If it is not, return `False`.

5. **Recursive Calls**: Recursively call the helper function for the left child of the current node, updating the `max_val` to the current node's value (since all values in the left subtree must be less than the current node's value). For the right child, update the `min_val` to the current node's value (since all values in the right subtree must be greater).

6. **Combine Results**: Return the result of the recursive calls for both the left and right children. The tree is a valid BST if both subtrees are valid.

Here’s a simple pseudocode representation of the above logic:

```python
def is_valid_bst(root):
    def helper(node, min_val, max_val):
        if not node:
            return True
        if not (min_val < node.val < max_val):
            return False
        return (helper(node.left, min_val, node.val) and
                helper(node.right, node.val, max_val))
    
    return helper(root, float('-inf'), float('inf'))
```

In this pseudocode:
- `float('-inf')` and `float('inf')` are used to represent the initial bounds for the root node.
- The helper function checks each node against its allowed range and recursively validates the left and right subtrees.

By following this approach, you can effectively determine if a binary tree is a valid binary search tree.


[Critique]
To fix the issue, ensure that the 'TreeNode' class is defined before it is used, or import it from a module where it is defined. The 'TreeNode' class should represent the structure of a node in a binary tree, typically with attributes for the value of the node and references to the left and right child nodes.


INFO - [Task id] 93 [generation text] Explain: The error message indicates that the `TreeNode` class is not defined in the environment where the `is_valid_bst` function is being tested. The `TreeNode` class is essential for creating the binary tree nodes that the `is_valid_bst` function expects as input.

Plan:
1) Define the `TreeNode` class with attributes for the value of the node and references to the left and right child nodes.
2) Implement the `is_valid_bst` function using the recursive helper function approach as described in the context.
3) The `is_valid_bst` function will use the `TreeNode` class for its input parameter type hint.

[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)
