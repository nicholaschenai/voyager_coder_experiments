Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. As a rule of thumb, guide me through beginner problems, followed by interview level problems, followed by competitive programming problems. The latter 2 levels can involve concepts from data structures and algorithms.
2) Please be very specific about what skills I need to learn.
3) Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for problems which I have not solved yet. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) The task should involve writing a main Python function that at most use basic libraries (try not to import too many or too advanced modules)
7) Do not give tasks that require file operations (create, read, update, delete) or an internet connection.
8) I am only allowed to write Python functions, so do not require me to write other things (e.g. objects). 
9) Requiring me to write a function that takes in an object and uses object methods is still ok, but I cannot define the objects myself. You must provide the objects as input to my function in the assert statement.

Take note of these in your response:
1) Give an expected function name for the task.
2) Give a tuple of 3 assert statements that tests the function's correctness in the "test_tuple" field. This must strictly contain single-line assert statements only; any setup code for the test must be filled in the "test_setup_code" field.
3) The function name which you gave must be called in the assert statements.

}

INFO - [Task id] 16 [prompt] Question 1: How do you implement a binary search algorithm in Python?
Answer: To implement a binary search algorithm in Python, you can use either an iterative or a recursive approach. Below are examples of both methods.

### Iterative Approach

```python
def binary_search_iterative(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To avoid overflow
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Target found
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1  # Search in the right half
        else:
            right = mid - 1  # Search in the left half
            
    return -1  # Target not found
```

### Recursive Approach

```python
def binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, right):
    if left > right:
        return -1  # Target not found
    
    mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To avoid overflow
    
    if arr[mid] == target:
        return mid  # Target found
    elif arr[mid] < target:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, mid + 1, right)  # Search in the right half
    else:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, mid - 1)  # Search in the left half

# To use the recursive function, call it like this:
# result = binary_search_recursive(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
```

### Usage Example

```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
target = 5

# Using iterative approach
result_iterative = binary_search_iterative(arr, target)
print("Iterative result:", result_iterative)

# Using recursive approach
result_recursive = binary_search_recursive(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
print("Recursive result:", result_recursive)
```

Make sure the array is sorted before performing a binary search, as the algorithm assumes a sorted input.

Question 2: What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?
Answer: The main differences between a list and a tuple in Python are:

1. **Mutability**: Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their content (add, remove, or modify elements) after they are created. Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable, which means once a tuple is created, you cannot change its content.

2. **Syntax**: Lists are defined using square brackets `[]`, while tuples are defined using parentheses `()`.

3. **Performance**: Tuples can be slightly more memory-efficient and faster than lists for certain operations because of their immutability.

4. **Use Cases**: Lists are generally used for collections of items that may need to be modified, while tuples are often used for fixed collections of items, such as coordinates or records.

Example:
```python
# List
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)  # This is allowed

# Tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
# my_tuple.append(4)  # This would raise an AttributeError
```

In summary, use lists when you need a mutable sequence and tuples when you need an immutable sequence.

Question 3: How do you merge two dictionaries in Python?
Answer: You can merge two dictionaries in Python using several methods. Here are a few common ways:

1. **Using the `update()` method**:
   ```python
   dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
   dict2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}
   dict1.update(dict2)
   # dict1 is now {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
   ```

2. **Using the `**` unpacking operator (Python 3.5+)**:
   ```python
   dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
   dict2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}
   merged_dict = {**dict1, **dict2}
   # merged_dict is {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
   ```

3. **Using the `|` operator (Python 3.9+)**:
   ```python
   dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
   dict2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}
   merged_dict = dict1 | dict2
   # merged_dict is {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
   ```

4. **Using dictionary comprehension**:
   ```python
   dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
   dict2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}
   merged_dict = {k: v for d in (dict1, dict2) for k, v in d.items()}
   # merged_dict is {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
   ```

Choose the method that best fits your needs based on the version of Python you are using and your specific requirements.

Question 4: What are list comprehensions and how do you use them?
Answer: List comprehensions are a concise way to create lists in Python. They provide a syntactic shortcut for generating lists based on existing lists or other iterable objects. The basic syntax of a list comprehension is:

```python
[expression for item in iterable if condition]
```

- `expression` is the value to be included in the new list.
- `item` is the variable that takes the value of each element in the iterable.
- `iterable` is any Python iterable (like a list, tuple, or string).
- `condition` is an optional filter that determines whether the `expression` should be included in the new list.

Here are a few examples of how to use list comprehensions:

1. **Creating a list of squares:**
   ```python
   squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
   # squares will be [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
   ```

2. **Filtering even numbers:**
   ```python
   even_numbers = [x for x in range(20) if x % 2 == 0]
   # even_numbers will be [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]
   ```

3. **Converting strings to uppercase:**
   ```python
   words = ['hello', 'world', 'python']
   uppercase_words = [word.upper() for word in words]
   # uppercase_words will be ['HELLO', 'WORLD', 'PYTHON']
   ```

List comprehensions can make your code more readable and concise, especially when dealing with simple transformations and filtering of lists.

Question 5: How do you handle exceptions in Python?
Answer: In Python, exceptions are handled using the `try` and `except` blocks. You can place the code that may raise an exception inside the `try` block, and then handle the exception in the `except` block. Here’s a basic example:

```python
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    # Code to handle the exception
    print("You cannot divide by zero!")
```

You can also catch multiple exceptions, use the `else` block for code that should run if no exceptions occur, and the `finally` block for code that should run regardless of whether an exception occurred or not:

```python
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
    result = 10 / 2
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You cannot divide by zero!")
except TypeError:
    print("Invalid type!")
else:
    print("Result is:", result)
finally:
    print("This will always execute.")
```

This structure allows for robust error handling in your Python programs.

INFO - [Task id] 16 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
Write a Python function that takes a sorted list of integers and an integer target value, and returns a tuple of two numbers from the list that add up to the target value. If no such pair exists, return None.
INFO - [Task id] 16 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding two numbers in a sorted list that add up to a given target value, you can use a two-pointer approach. Here’s a conceptual breakdown of how this can be done:

1. **Initialize Pointers**: Start with two pointers: one at the beginning of the list (let's call it `left`) and the other at the end of the list (let's call it `right`).

2. **Iterate and Check Sums**: In a loop, check the sum of the values at the `left` and `right` pointers:
   - If the sum is equal to the target value, return the pair as a tuple.
   - If the sum is less than the target, increment the `left` pointer to increase the sum (since the list is sorted).
   - If the sum is greater than the target, decrement the `right` pointer to decrease the sum.

3. **Continue Until Pointers Meet**: Repeat the process until the `left` pointer is no longer less than the `right` pointer. If no pair is found by the time the pointers meet, return `None`.

This method is efficient because it only requires a single pass through the list, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).

Here’s a simple outline of what the function might look like in Python:

```python
def find_pair_with_sum(sorted_list, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(sorted_list) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        current_sum = sorted_list[left] + sorted_list[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return (sorted_list[left], sorted_list[right])
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
            
    return None
```

This function will effectively find and return the desired pair or `None` if no such pair exists.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

No code in the first round

[Task]
Write a Python function that takes a sorted list of integers and an integer target value, and returns a tuple of two numbers from the list that add up to the target value. If no such pair exists, return None.
You must strictly follow the function name: find_pair_with_sum

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding two numbers in a sorted list that add up to a given target value, you can use a two-pointer approach. Here’s a conceptual breakdown of how this can be done:

1. **Initialize Pointers**: Start with two pointers: one at the beginning of the list (let's call it `left`) and the other at the end of the list (let's call it `right`).

2. **Iterate and Check Sums**: In a loop, check the sum of the values at the `left` and `right` pointers:
   - If the sum is equal to the target value, return the pair as a tuple.
   - If the sum is less than the target, increment the `left` pointer to increase the sum (since the list is sorted).
   - If the sum is greater than the target, decrement the `right` pointer to decrease the sum.

3. **Continue Until Pointers Meet**: Repeat the process until the `left` pointer is no longer less than the `right` pointer. If no pair is found by the time the pointers meet, return `None`.

This method is efficient because it only requires a single pass through the list, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).

Here’s a simple outline of what the function might look like in Python:

```python
def find_pair_with_sum(sorted_list, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(sorted_list) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        current_sum = sorted_list[left] + sorted_list[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return (sorted_list[left], sorted_list[right])
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
            
    return None
```

This function will effectively find and return the desired pair or `None` if no such pair exists.


[Critique]
None


INFO - [Task id] 16 [generation text] Explain: The context provided a clear and correct plan for implementing the `find_pair_with_sum` function. It uses the two-pointer technique which is an optimal solution for this problem given that the list is already sorted.

Plan:
1) Define the function `find_pair_with_sum` with parameters `sorted_list` and `target`.
2) Initialize two pointers, `left` at the start of the list and `right` at the end of the list.
3) Use a while loop to iterate as long as `left` is less than `right`.
4) Inside the loop, calculate the sum of the values at the `left` and `right` pointers.
5) If the sum is equal to the target, return the pair as a tuple.
6) If the sum is less than the target, increment the `left` pointer to move towards a larger sum.
7) If the sum is greater than the target, decrement the `right` pointer to move towards a smaller sum.
8) If the loop ends without finding a pair, return `None`.

Code:
```python
def find_pair_with_sum(sorted_list, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(sorted_list) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        current_sum = sorted_list[left] + sorted_list[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return (sorted_list[left], sorted_list[right])
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1

You are a Python programming assistant that assesses my progress of Python programming and provides useful guidance.

I will give you the following information:

[Task]: The objective I need to accomplish.
[Context]: The context of the task. Serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help me on the task, but my priority is to follow instructions in the Task tag.
[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

You should only respond in JSON format as described below:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

[Task]
Write a Python function that takes a sorted list of integers and an integer target value, and returns a tuple of two numbers from the list that add up to the target value. If no such pair exists, return None.
You must strictly follow the function name: find_pair_with_sum

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding two numbers in a sorted list that add up to a given target value, you can use a two-pointer approach. Here’s a conceptual breakdown of how this can be done:

1. **Initialize Pointers**: Start with two pointers: one at the beginning of the list (let's call it `left`) and the other at the end of the list (let's call it `right`).

2. **Iterate and Check Sums**: In a loop, check the sum of the values at the `left` and `right` pointers:
   - If the sum is equal to the target value, return the pair as a tuple.
   - If the sum is less than the target, increment the `left` pointer to increase the sum (since the list is sorted).
   - If the sum is greater than the target, decrement the `right` pointer to decrease the sum.

3. **Continue Until Pointers Meet**: Repeat the process until the `left` pointer is no longer less than the `right` pointer. If no pair is found by the time the pointers meet, return `None`.

This method is efficient because it only requires a single pass through the list, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).

Here’s a simple outline of what the function might look like in Python:

```python
def find_pair_with_sum(sorted_list, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(sorted_list) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        current_sum = sorted_list[left] + sorted_list[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return (sorted_list[left], sorted_list[right])
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
            
    return None
```

This function will effectively find and return the desired pair or `None` if no such pair exists.


[Critique]
The function implementation is correct, but the unit test is wrong. The expected output for the test case should be (-1, 1) instead of (-3, 3), as there is no 3 in the list. Correct the expected result in the unit test to match the correct output.


INFO - [Task id] 16 [generation text] Explain: The critique is correct. The test case is expecting a pair that includes a number (3) which is not present in the list. The correct pair that adds up to 0 is indeed (-1, 1), and the function `find_pair_with_sum` is working as expected.

Plan:
1) Since the function `find_pair_with_sum` is already correct, there is no need to modify it.
2) The only action needed is to correct the test case to expect the right output.

Code:
```python
def find_pair_with_sum(sorted_list, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(sorted_list) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = sorted_list[left] + sorted_list[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return (sorted_list[left], sorted_list[right])

You are a Python programming assistant that assesses my progress of Python programming and provides useful guidance.

I will give you the following information:

[Task]: The objective I need to accomplish.
[Context]: The context of the task. Serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help me on the task, but my priority is to follow instructions in the Task tag.
[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

You should only respond in JSON format as described below:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

To overcome this error, we should change the condition to only update the result when the current subarray length is strictly greater than the previous longest subarray length.

Write a Python function that takes a sorted list of integers and an integer target value, and returns a tuple of two numbers from the list that add up to the target value. If no such pair exists, return None.
You must strictly follow the function name: find_pair_with_sum

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding two numbers in a sorted list that add up to a given target value, you can use a two-pointer approach. Here’s a conceptual breakdown of how this can be done:

1. **Initialize Pointers**: Start with two pointers: one at the beginning of the list (let's call it `left`) and the other at the end of the list (let's call it `right`).

2. **Iterate and Check Sums**: In a loop, check the sum of the values at the `left` and `right` pointers:
   - If the sum is equal to the target value, return the pair as a tuple.
   - If the sum is less than the target, increment the `left` pointer to increase the sum (since the list is sorted).
   - If the sum is greater than the target, decrement the `right` pointer to decrease the sum.

3. **Continue Until Pointers Meet**: Repeat the process until the `left` pointer is no longer less than the `right` pointer. If no pair is found by the time the pointers meet, return `None`.

This method is efficient because it only requires a single pass through the list, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).

Here’s a simple outline of what the function might look like in Python:

```python
def find_pair_with_sum(sorted_list, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(sorted_list) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        current_sum = sorted_list[left] + sorted_list[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return (sorted_list[left], sorted_list[right])
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
            
    return None
```

This function will effectively find and return the desired pair or `None` if no such pair exists.


[Critique]
The function implementation is correct, but the unit test is wrong. The expected output for the test case should be (-1, 1) instead of (-3, 3), as there is no 3 in the list. Correct the expected result in the unit test to match the correct output.


INFO - [Task id] 16 [generation text] Explain: The critique is correct. The test case is expecting a pair that includes a number (3) which is not present in the list. The correct pair that adds up to 0 is indeed (-1, 1), and the function `find_pair_with_sum` is working as expected.

Plan:
1) Since the function `find_pair_with_sum` is already correct, there is no need to modify it.
2) The only action needed is to correct the test case to expect the right output.

Code:
```python
def find_pair_with_sum(sorted_list, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(sorted_list) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = sorted_list[left] + sorted_list[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return (sorted_list[left], sorted_list[right])
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return None

You are a Python programming assistant that assesses my progress of Python programming and provides useful guidance.

I will give you the following information:

[Task]: The objective I need to accomplish.
[Context]: The context of the task. Serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help me on the task, but my priority is to follow instructions in the Task tag.
[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

You should only respond in JSON format as described below:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

[Task]
Write a Python function that takes a sorted list of integers and an integer target value, and returns a tuple of two numbers from the list that add up to the target value. If no such pair exists, return None.
You must strictly follow the function name: find_pair_with_sum

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding two numbers in a sorted list that add up to a given target value, you can use a two-pointer approach. Here’s a conceptual breakdown of how this can be done:

3. **Continue Until Pointers Meet**: Repeat the process until the `left` pointer is no longer less than the `right` pointer. If no pair is found by the time the pointers meet, return `None`.

This method is efficient because it only requires a single pass through the list, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).

    left = 0
    right = len(sorted_list) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        current_sum = sorted_list[left] + sorted_list[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return (sorted_list[left], sorted_list[right])
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
            
    return None
```

This function will effectively find and return the desired pair or `None` if no such pair exists.


[Critique]
The function implementation is correct, but the unit test is wrong. The expected output for the test case should be (-1, 1) instead of (-3, 3), as there is no 3 in the list. Correct the expected result in the unit test to match the correct output.


INFO - [Task id] 16 [generation text] Explain: The critique is correct. The test case is expecting a pair that includes a number (3) which is not present in the list. The correct pair that adds up to 0 is indeed (-1, 1), and the function `find_pair_with_sum` is working as expected.

Plan:
1) Since the function `find_pair_with_sum` is already correct, there is no need to modify it.
2) The only action needed is to correct the test case to expect the right output.

Code:
```python
def find_pair_with_sum(sorted_list, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(sorted_list) - 1
    while left < right:

 Explain: The critique is correct. The test case is expecting a pair that includes a number (3) which is not present in the list. The correct pair that adds up to 0 is indeed (-1, 1), and the function `find_pair_with_sum` is working as expected.

Plan:
1) Since the function `find_pair_with_sum` is already correct, there is no need to modify it.
2) The only action needed is to correct the test case to expect the right output.

Code:
```python
def find_pair_with_sum(sorted_list, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(sorted_list) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = sorted_list[left] + sorted_list[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return (sorted_list[left], sorted_list[right])
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1

You are a Python programming assistant that assesses my progress of Python programming and provides useful guidance.

I will give you the following information:

[Task]: The objective I need to accomplish.
[Context]: The context of the task. Serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help me on the task, but my priority is to follow instructions in the Task tag.
[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

You should only respond in JSON format as described below:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Because of this, it returns a subarray even when the sum is greater than the target, as it still updates the result when the current subarray length is equal to the previous longest subarray length. To overcome this error, we should change the condition to only update the result when the current subarray length is strictly greater than the previous longest subarray length.

INFO - [Task id] 16 [prompt] [Task]:
Write a Python function that takes a sorted list of integers and an integer target value, and returns a tuple of two numbers from the list that add up to the target value. If no such pair exists, return None.
[Context]: 
 Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding two numbers in a sorted list that add up to a given target value, you can use a two-pointer approach. Here’s a conceptual breakdown of how this can be done:

1. **Initialize Pointers**: Start with two pointers: one at the beginning of the list (let's call it `left`) and the other at the end of the list (let's call it `right`).

2. **Iterate and Check Sums**: In a loop, check the sum of the values at the `left` and `right` pointers:
   - If the sum is equal to the target value, return the pair as a tuple.
   - If the sum is less than the target, increment the `left` pointer to increase the sum (since the list is sorted).
   - If the sum is greater than the target, decrement the `right` pointer to decrease the sum.

3. **Continue Until Pointers Meet**: Repeat the process until the `left` pointer is no longer less than the `right` pointer. If no pair is found by the time the pointers meet, return `None`.

This method is efficient because it only requires a single pass through the list, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).

Here’s a simple outline of what the function might look like in Python:

```python
def find_pair_with_sum(sorted_list, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(sorted_list) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        current_sum = sorted_list[left] + sorted_list[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return (sorted_list[left], sorted_list[right])
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
            
    return None
```

This function will effectively find and return the desired pair or `None` if no such pair exists.
