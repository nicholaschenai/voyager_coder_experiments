You are a helpful assistant that asks questions to help me decide the next immediate task to do for Python programming.
My ultimate goal is to solve as many diverse problems as possible and become the best programmer in the world.

I will give you the following information:
Completed tasks so far: ...
Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should ask at least 5 questions (but no more than 10 questions) to help me decide the next immediate task to do. Each question should be followed by the concept that the question is about.
2) Your question should be specific to a concept in Python programming.
  Bad example (the question is too general):
    Question: What is the best way to program in Python?
    Concept: unknown
  Good example:
    Question: How do you reverse a list?
    Concept: list
3) Your questions should be self-contained and not require any context.

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:

	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list with the squares of all the numbers. The function should not modify the original list.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the unique elements from the original list. The order of elements in the returned list does not matter.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a set containing all the elements that appear more than once in the list.
	Write a Python function that calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It is denoted by n!.
	Write a Python function that takes a string and returns True if the string is a palindrome, and False otherwise. The function should be case-insensitive and ignore all non-alphanumeric characters.
	Write a Python function that takes a dictionary and a key, and returns the value associated with the key. If the key does not exist in the dictionary, the function should return 'Key not found.'

	Write a Python function that takes a string and returns the first non-repeating character in it. If all characters repeat or the string is empty, return None.
	Write a Python function that simulates a producer-consumer scenario using a queue. The function should take a list of integers as input, where each integer represents an item produced. The function should process (consume) each item by simply printing it and then return the number of items consumed. Use a simple list to simulate the queue behavior.
	Write a Python function that takes an integer n and returns the nth Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The function should use recursion to calculate the result.
	Write a Python function that takes a string and returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of strings and returns a new list with the strings sorted based on the number of vowels they contain. The sort should be in descending order, and in case of a tie, the strings should be sorted alphabetically.
	Write a Python function that takes a string and returns the character that appears the most frequently in the string. If there is a tie, return the character that appears first in the string. If the string is empty, return None.
	Write a Python function that takes a string representing a mathematical expression consisting of non-negative integers and the plus sign (+) and returns the result of the expression. The function should assume that the input is always a valid expression and that there are no spaces between numbers and operators.

INFO - [Task id] 21 [prompt] Question: How do you find the largest product of two numbers in a list?
INFO - [Task id] 21 [generation text] Answer: To find the largest product of two numbers in a list, you can follow these steps:

1. Sort the list in descending order.
2. The largest product will be the maximum of the product of the two largest numbers or the product of the two smallest numbers (in case there are negative numbers).

Here is a sample implementation in Python:

```python
def largest_product(numbers):
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("List must contain at least two numbers.")
    
    # Sort the list
    numbers.sort()
    
    # Calculate the product of the two largest and two smallest numbers
    product1 = numbers[-1] * numbers[-2]  # Product of the two largest
    product2 = numbers[0] * numbers[1]    # Product of the two smallest
    
    # Return the maximum product
    return max(product1, product2)

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 10, -5, 1, -100]
print(largest_product(numbers))  # Output: 1000
```

This function first checks if there are at least two numbers in the list, sorts the list, and then calculates the products of the two largest and two smallest numbers to find the largest product.

INFO - [Task id] 21 [prompt] Question: How do you implement a stack using a list in Python?
INFO - [Task id] 21 [generation text] Answer: You can implement a stack using a list in Python by utilizing the list's built-in methods. A stack follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Here’s a simple implementation:

```python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.items) == 0

    def push(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)

    def pop(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items.pop()
        else:
            raise IndexError("pop from empty stack")

    def peek(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items[-1]
        else:
            raise IndexError("peek from empty stack")

    def size(self):
        return len(self.items)

# Example usage:
stack = Stack()
stack.push(1)
stack.push(2)
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 2
print(stack.peek())  # Output: 1
print(stack.size())  # Output: 1
```

In this implementation:
- `push(item)` adds an item to the top of the stack.
- `pop()` removes and returns the top item of the stack.
- `peek()` returns the top item without removing it.
- `is_empty()` checks if the stack is empty.
- `size()` returns the number of items in the stack.

INFO - [Task id] 21 [prompt] Question: How can you create a simple text-based game using Python?
INFO - [Task id] 21 [generation text] Answer: To create a simple text-based game in Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Define the Game Concept**: Decide on the type of game you want to create. For example, a guessing game, adventure game, or quiz.

2. **Set Up the Game Loop**: Use a loop to keep the game running until a certain condition is met (like winning or quitting).

3. **Get User Input**: Use the `input()` function to get responses from the player.

4. **Implement Game Logic**: Based on the player's input, implement the rules of the game using conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`).

5. **Provide Feedback**: Give the player feedback based on their actions, such as telling them if they won, lost, or made a wrong choice.

6. **End the Game**: Decide how the game will end and provide a way for the player to exit.

Here’s a simple example of a number guessing game:

```python
import random

def guessing_game():
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)
    attempts = 0
    print("Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!")
    print("I have selected a number between 1 and 100. Can you guess it?")

    while True:
        guess = input("Enter your guess (or type 'exit' to quit): ")
        if guess.lower() == 'exit':
            print("Thanks for playing!")
            break
        
        attempts += 1
        try:
            guess = int(guess)
        except ValueError:
            print("Please enter a valid number.")
            continue

        if guess < number_to_guess:
            print("Too low! Try again.")
        elif guess > number_to_guess:
            print("Too high! Try again.")
        else:
            print(f"Congratulations! You've guessed the number {number_to_guess} in {attempts} attempts.")
            break

guessing_game()
```

In this example:
- The game randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
- The player is prompted to guess the number.
- The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.
- The player can exit the game by typing 'exit'.

You can expand this basic structure to create more complex games by adding features like levels, scoring, or more intricate storylines.

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. As a rule of thumb, guide me through beginner problems, followed by interview level problems, followed by competitive programming problems. The latter 2 levels can involve concepts from data structures and algorithms.
2) Please be very specific about what skills I need to learn.
3) Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for problems which I have not solved yet. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) The task should involve writing a main Python function that at most use basic libraries (try not to import too many or too advanced modules)
7) Do not give tasks that require file operations (create, read, update, delete) or an internet connection.
8) I am only allowed to write Python functions, so do not require me to write other things (e.g. objects). 
9) Requiring me to write a function that takes in an object and uses object methods is still ok, but I cannot define the objects myself. You must provide the objects as input to my function in the assert statement.

Take note of these in your response:
1) Give an expected function name for the task.
2) Give a tuple of 3 assert statements that tests the function's correctness in the "test_tuple" field. This must strictly contain single-line assert statements only; any setup code for the test must be filled in the "test_setup_code" field.
3) The function name which you gave must be called in the assert statements.

INFO - [Task id] 21 [prompt] Question 1: How do you find the largest product of two numbers in a list?
Answer: To find the largest product of two numbers in a list, you can follow these steps:

1. Sort the list in descending order.
2. The largest product will be the maximum of the product of the two largest numbers or the product of the two smallest numbers (in case there are negative numbers).

Here is a sample implementation in Python:

```python
def largest_product(numbers):
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("List must contain at least two numbers.")
    
    # Sort the list
    numbers.sort()
    
    # Calculate the product of the two largest and two smallest numbers
    product1 = numbers[-1] * numbers[-2]  # Product of the two largest
    product2 = numbers[0] * numbers[1]    # Product of the two smallest
    
    # Return the maximum product
    return max(product1, product2)

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 10, -5, 1, -100]
print(largest_product(numbers))  # Output: 1000
```

This function first checks if there are at least two numbers in the list, sorts the list, and then calculates the products of the two largest and two smallest numbers to find the largest product.

Question 2: How do you implement a binary search algorithm in Python?
Answer: To implement a binary search algorithm in Python, you can use either an iterative or a recursive approach. Below are examples of both methods.

### Iterative Approach

```python
def binary_search_iterative(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To avoid overflow
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Target found
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1  # Search in the right half
        else:
            right = mid - 1  # Search in the left half
            
    return -1  # Target not found
```

### Recursive Approach

```python
def binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, right):
    if left > right:
        return -1  # Target not found
    
    mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To avoid overflow
    
    if arr[mid] == target:
        return mid  # Target found
    elif arr[mid] < target:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, mid + 1, right)  # Search in the right half
    else:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, mid - 1)  # Search in the left half

# To use the recursive function, call it like this:
# result = binary_search_recursive(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
```

### Usage Example

```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
target = 5

# Using iterative approach
result_iterative = binary_search_iterative(arr, target)
print("Iterative result:", result_iterative)

# Using recursive approach
result_recursive = binary_search_recursive(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
print("Recursive result:", result_recursive)
```

Make sure the array is sorted before performing a binary search, as the algorithm assumes a sorted input.

Question 3: What is the best way to merge two sorted lists into one sorted list?
Answer: The best way to merge two sorted lists into one sorted list is to use a two-pointer technique. Here’s a simple implementation in Python:

```python
def merge_sorted_lists(list1, list2):
    merged_list = []
    i, j = 0, 0

    while i < len(list1) and j < len(list2):
        if list1[i] < list2[j]:
            merged_list.append(list1[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            merged_list.append(list2[j])
            j += 1

    # Append any remaining elements from list1
    while i < len(list1):
        merged_list.append(list1[i])
        i += 1

    # Append any remaining elements from list2
    while j < len(list2):
        merged_list.append(list2[j])
        j += 1

    return merged_list

# Example usage:
list1 = [1, 3, 5]
list2 = [2, 4, 6]
result = merge_sorted_lists(list1, list2)
print(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

This method efficiently merges the two lists in O(n + m) time complexity, where n and m are the lengths of the two lists.

Question 4: How do you implement a stack using a list in Python?
Answer: You can implement a stack using a list in Python by utilizing the list's built-in methods. A stack follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Here’s a simple implementation:

```python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.items) == 0

    def push(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)

    def pop(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items.pop()
        else:
            raise IndexError("pop from empty stack")

    def peek(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items[-1]
        else:
            raise IndexError("peek from empty stack")

    def size(self):
        return len(self.items)

# Example usage:
stack = Stack()
stack.push(1)
stack.push(2)
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 2
print(stack.peek())  # Output: 1
print(stack.size())  # Output: 1
```

In this implementation:
- `push(item)` adds an item to the top of the stack.
- `pop()` removes and returns the top item of the stack.
- `peek()` returns the top item without removing it.
- `is_empty()` checks if the stack is empty.
- `size()` returns the number of items in the stack.

Question 5: How can you create a simple text-based game using Python?
Answer: To create a simple text-based game in Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Define the Game Concept**: Decide on the type of game you want to create. For example, a guessing game, adventure game, or quiz.

2. **Set Up the Game Loop**: Use a loop to keep the game running until a certain condition is met (like winning or quitting).

3. **Get User Input**: Use the `input()` function to get responses from the player.

4. **Implement Game Logic**: Based on the player's input, implement the rules of the game using conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`).

5. **Provide Feedback**: Give the player feedback based on their actions, such as telling them if they won, lost, or made a wrong choice.

6. **End the Game**: Decide how the game will end and provide a way for the player to exit.

Here’s a simple example of a number guessing game:

```python
import random

def guessing_game():
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)
    attempts = 0
    print("Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!")
    print("I have selected a number between 1 and 100. Can you guess it?")

    while True:
        guess = input("Enter your guess (or type 'exit' to quit): ")
        if guess.lower() == 'exit':
            print("Thanks for playing!")
            break
        
        attempts += 1
        try:
            guess = int(guess)
        except ValueError:
            print("Please enter a valid number.")
            continue

        if guess < number_to_guess:
            print("Too low! Try again.")
        elif guess > number_to_guess:
            print("Too high! Try again.")
        else:
            print(f"Congratulations! You've guessed the number {number_to_guess} in {attempts} attempts.")
            break

guessing_game()
```

In this example:
- The game randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
- The player is prompted to guess the number.
- The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.
- The player can exit the game by typing 'exit'.

You can expand this basic structure to create more complex games by adding features like levels, scoring, or more intricate storylines.

Completed tasks so far (do not give me these tasks again!): 
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list with the squares of all the numbers. The function should not modify the original list.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the unique elements from the original list. The order of elements in the returned list does not matter.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a set containing all the elements that appear more than once in the list.
	Write a Python function that calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It is denoted by n!.
	Write a Python function that takes a string and returns True if the string is a palindrome, and False otherwise. The function should be case-insensitive and ignore all non-alphanumeric characters.
	Write a Python function that takes a dictionary and a key, and returns the value associated with the key. If the key does not exist in the dictionary, the function should return 'Key not found.'
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the first recurring character. If there is no recurring character, return None.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list with the integers sorted in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.
	Write a Python function that takes a string and returns the first non-repeating character in it. If all characters repeat or the string is empty, return None.
	Write a Python function that simulates a producer-consumer scenario using a queue. The function should take a list of integers as input, where each integer represents an item produced. The function should process (consume) each item by simply printing it and then return the number of items consumed. Use a simple list to simulate the queue behavior.
	Write a Python function that takes an integer n and returns the nth Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The function should use recursion to calculate the result.
	Write a Python function that takes a string and returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of strings and returns a new list with the strings sorted based on the number of vowels they contain. The sort should be in descending order, and in case of a tie, the strings should be sorted alphabetically.
	Write a Python function that takes a string and returns the character that appears the most frequently in the string. If there is a tie, return the character that appears first in the string. If the string is empty, return None.
	Write a Python function that takes a string representing a mathematical expression consisting of non-negative integers and the plus sign (+) and returns the result of the expression. The function should assume that the input is always a valid expression and that there are no spaces between numbers and operators.
	Write a Python function that takes an integer n and returns the sum of all integers from 1 to n using recursion.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list with the integers sorted in ascending order using the selection sort algorithm.
	Write a Python function that takes a string containing only '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', and determines if the input string is valid. A string is considered valid if brackets are closed in the correct order. For example, "()" and "()[]{}" are valid, but "(]" and "([)]" are not.
	Write a Python function that simulates a basic queue system. The function should take a list of integers representing people's ticket numbers and return the ticket number of the person who will be served last. Use the deque from the collections module to implement the queue.

Failed tasks that are too hard: 
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the largest product that can be obtained by multiplying any two numbers from the list.
	Write a Python function that takes a sorted list of integers and an integer target value, and returns a tuple of two numbers from the list that add up to the target value. If no such pair exists, return None.

INFO - [Task id] 21 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
Write a Python function that takes two lists of integers and returns a list containing the elements that are common to both lists without duplicates. The order of the elements in the returned list does not matter.
INFO - [Task id] 21 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding common elements between two lists of integers without duplicates, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Input the Lists**: Define a function that takes two lists as parameters.

2. **Convert to Sets**: Use Python's built-in `set` data structure to convert both lists into sets. This will automatically remove any duplicate elements within each list.

3. **Find Intersection**: Use the set intersection operation to find common elements between the two sets. In Python, this can be done using the `&` operator or the `.intersection()` method.

4. **Convert Back to List**: Convert the resulting set of common elements back into a list, if needed.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the list of common elements.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def find_common_elements(list1, list2):
    # Step 2: Convert lists to sets
    set1 = set(list1)
    set2 = set(list2)
    
    # Step 3: Find intersection
    common_elements = set1 & set2  # or set1.intersection(set2)
    
    # Step 4: Convert back to list
    return list(common_elements)  # Step 5: Return the result
```

This function will return a list of unique elements that are present in both input lists, and the order of elements in the returned list does not matter.

[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

RESPONSE:
{
    "reason": "The implementation failed 4 out of the 7 test cases due to an IndexError.",
    "success": false,
    "critique": "The issue stems from the while loop while current_sum + nums[right] <= target:, which directly accesses nums[right] without checking if right is within the bounds of the list. This results in a runtime error when right goes beyond the list length. To overcome this error, we need to add a bounds check for the right variable in the mentioned while loop. We can modify the loop condition to while right < len(nums) and current_sum + nums[right] <= target:. This change will ensure that we only access elements within the bounds of the list, thus avoiding the IndexError."

INFO - [Task id] 21 [prompt] [Task]:
Write a Python function that takes two lists of integers and returns a list containing the elements that are common to both lists without duplicates. The order of the elements in the returned list does not matter.
[Context]: 
 Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding common elements between two lists of integers without duplicates, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Input the Lists**: Define a function that takes two lists as parameters.

2. **Convert to Sets**: Use Python's built-in `set` data structure to convert both lists into sets. This will automatically remove any duplicate elements within each list.

3. **Find Intersection**: Use the set intersection operation to find common elements between the two sets. In Python, this can be done using the `&` operator or the `.intersection()` method.

4. **Convert Back to List**: Convert the resulting set of common elements back into a list, if needed.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the list of common elements.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def find_common_elements(list1, list2):
    # Step 2: Convert lists to sets
    set1 = set(list1)
    set2 = set(list2)
    
    # Step 3: Find intersection
    common_elements = set1 & set2  # or set1.intersection(set2)
    
    # Step 4: Convert back to list
    return list(common_elements)  # Step 5: Return the result
```

This function will return a list of unique elements that are present in both input lists, and the order of elements in the returned list does not matter.

def find_common_elements(list1, list2):
    set1 = set(list1)
    set2 = set(list2)

    common_elements_list = list(common_elements_set)
    return common_elements_list

def find_common_elements(list1, list2):
    set1 = set(list1)
    set2 = set(list2)
    common_elements_set = set1.intersection(set2)
    common_elements_list = list(common_elements_set)

The main function is `find_common_elements`.
INFO - [Task id] 21 [generation text] This function takes two lists as input and converts them into sets to eliminate duplicates. It then finds the intersection of these two sets, which contains the elements that are common to both lists. The common elements are converted back into a list format. Finally, the function returns this list of common elements. This approach efficiently identifies shared items between the two input lists. The result is a list containing only the elements that appear in both original lists.
