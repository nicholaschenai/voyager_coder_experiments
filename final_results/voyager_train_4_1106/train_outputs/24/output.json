The expected result for the test case assert longest_consecutive_sequence([10, 9, 2, 1, 4, 3, 7, 6, 8]) should be 5, not 10, because the longest consecutive sequence in this shuffled list is from 6 to 10, which has a length of 5. The test case should be corrected to reflect the right expected outcome."
