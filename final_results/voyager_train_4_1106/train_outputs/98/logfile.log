You are a helpful assistant that answer my question about Python programming.

I will give you the following information:
Question: ...

You will answer the question based on the context (only if available and helpful) and your own knowledge of Python programming.
1) Start your answer with "Answer: ".
2) Answer "Answer: Unknown" if you don't know the answer.

INFO - [Task id] 98 [prompt] Question: What is the sliding window technique and how can it be applied to solve problems?
INFO - [Task id] 98 [generation text] Answer: The sliding window technique is a common algorithmic approach used to solve problems that involve arrays or lists, particularly when dealing with contiguous subarrays or subsequences. The main idea is to maintain a "window" that can expand and contract as needed to explore different parts of the data structure without having to re-evaluate the entire array repeatedly.

Here's how the sliding window technique can be applied:

1. **Fixed-size window**: This is used when the size of the window is predetermined. For example, if you need to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size `k`, you can maintain a window of size `k` and slide it across the array, updating the sum as you go.

2. **Dynamic-size window**: This is used when the size of the window can change based on certain conditions. For example, if you need to find the longest substring without repeating characters, you can expand the window by adding characters until a duplicate is found, then contract the window from the left until the substring is valid again.

### Steps to implement the sliding window technique:

- **Initialize pointers**: Start with two pointers (or indices) that represent the current window's boundaries.
- **Expand the window**: Move the right pointer to include more elements in the window.
- **Contract the window**: Move the left pointer to exclude elements from the window when certain conditions are met (e.g., when a duplicate is found).
- **Update results**: Keep track of the best result found during the process (e.g., maximum sum, longest length, etc.).

### Example Problems:
- Finding the maximum sum of a subarray of size `k`.
- Finding the longest substring without repeating characters.
- Finding the smallest subarray with a sum greater than or equal to a given value.

The sliding window technique is efficient because it often reduces the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n), making it suitable for large datasets.

Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. As a rule of thumb, guide me through beginner problems, followed by interview level problems, followed by competitive programming problems. The latter 2 levels can involve concepts from data structures and algorithms.
2) Please be very specific about what skills I need to learn.
3) Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for problems which I have not solved yet. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) The task should involve writing a main Python function that at most use basic libraries (try not to import too many or too advanced modules)
7) Do not give tasks that require file operations (create, read, update, delete) or an internet connection.
8) I am only allowed to write Python functions, so do not require me to write other things (e.g. objects). 
9) Requiring me to write a function that takes in an object and uses object methods is still ok, but I cannot define the objects myself. You must provide the objects as input to my function in the assert statement.

Take note of these in your response:
1) Give an expected function name for the task.
2) Give a tuple of 3 assert statements that tests the function's correctness in the "test_tuple" field. This must strictly contain single-line assert statements only; any setup code for the test must be filled in the "test_setup_code" field.
3) The function name which you gave must be called in the assert statements. 

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

INFO - [Task id] 98 [prompt] Question 1: How do you implement a binary search algorithm in Python?
Answer: To implement a binary search algorithm in Python, you can use either an iterative or a recursive approach. Below are examples of both methods.

### Iterative Approach

```python
def binary_search_iterative(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To avoid overflow
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Target found
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1  # Search in the right half
        else:
            right = mid - 1  # Search in the left half
            
    return -1  # Target not found
```

### Recursive Approach

```python
def binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, right):
    if left > right:
        return -1  # Target not found
    
    mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To avoid overflow
    
    if arr[mid] == target:
        return mid  # Target found
    elif arr[mid] < target:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, mid + 1, right)  # Search in the right half
    else:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, mid - 1)  # Search in the left half

# To use the recursive function, call it like this:
# result = binary_search_recursive(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
```

### Usage Example

```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
target = 5

# Using iterative approach
result_iterative = binary_search_iterative(arr, target)
print("Iterative result:", result_iterative)

# Using recursive approach
result_recursive = binary_search_recursive(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
print("Recursive result:", result_recursive)
```

Make sure the array is sorted before performing a binary search, as the algorithm assumes a sorted input.

Question 2: What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?
Answer: The main differences between a list and a tuple in Python are:

1. **Mutability**: Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their content (add, remove, or modify elements) after they are created. Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable, which means once a tuple is created, you cannot change its content.

2. **Syntax**: Lists are defined using square brackets `[]`, while tuples are defined using parentheses `()`.

3. **Performance**: Tuples can be slightly more memory-efficient and faster than lists for certain operations because of their immutability.

4. **Use Cases**: Lists are generally used for collections of items that may need to be modified, while tuples are often used for fixed collections of items, such as coordinates or records.

Example:
```python
# List
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)  # This is allowed

# Tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
# my_tuple.append(4)  # This would raise an AttributeError
```

In summary, use lists when you need a mutable sequence and tuples when you need an immutable sequence.

Question 3: How can you use a dictionary to count the frequency of elements in a list?
Answer: You can use a dictionary to count the frequency of elements in a list by iterating through the list and updating the dictionary with the count of each element. Here’s a simple example:

```python
# Sample list
elements = ['apple', 'banana', 'apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'apple']

# Initialize an empty dictionary
frequency = {}

# Iterate through the list
for item in elements:
    if item in frequency:
        frequency[item] += 1  # Increment the count if the item is already in the dictionary
    else:
        frequency[item] = 1   # Initialize the count if the item is not in the dictionary

# Print the frequency dictionary
print(frequency)
```

In this example, the output will be:
```
{'apple': 3, 'banana': 2, 'orange': 1}
```

This shows the frequency of each element in the list. You can also use the `collections.Counter` class for a more concise solution:

```python
from collections import Counter

# Sample list
elements = ['apple', 'banana', 'apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'apple']

# Use Counter to count frequencies
frequency = Counter(elements)

# Print the frequency dictionary
print(frequency)
```

This will give you the same output in a more efficient way.

Question 4: What is the sliding window technique and how can it be applied to solve problems?
Answer: The sliding window technique is a common algorithmic approach used to solve problems that involve arrays or lists, particularly when dealing with contiguous subarrays or subsequences. The main idea is to maintain a "window" that can expand and contract as needed to explore different parts of the data structure without having to re-evaluate the entire array repeatedly.

Here's how the sliding window technique can be applied:

1. **Fixed-size window**: This is used when the size of the window is predetermined. For example, if you need to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size `k`, you can maintain a window of size `k` and slide it across the array, updating the sum as you go.

2. **Dynamic-size window**: This is used when the size of the window can change based on certain conditions. For example, if you need to find the longest substring without repeating characters, you can expand the window by adding characters until a duplicate is found, then contract the window from the left until the substring is valid again.

### Steps to implement the sliding window technique:

- **Initialize pointers**: Start with two pointers (or indices) that represent the current window's boundaries.
- **Expand the window**: Move the right pointer to include more elements in the window.
- **Contract the window**: Move the left pointer to exclude elements from the window when certain conditions are met (e.g., when a duplicate is found).
- **Update results**: Keep track of the best result found during the process (e.g., maximum sum, longest length, etc.).

### Example Problems:
- Finding the maximum sum of a subarray of size `k`.
- Finding the longest substring without repeating characters.
- Finding the smallest subarray with a sum greater than or equal to a given value.

The sliding window technique is efficient because it often reduces the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n), making it suitable for large datasets.

Question 5: How do you implement a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm for a graph in Python?
Answer: To implement a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm for a graph in Python, you can use either a recursive approach or an iterative approach using a stack. Below are examples of both methods.

### Recursive Approach

```python
def dfs_recursive(graph, node, visited=None):
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()
    
    visited.add(node)
    print(node)  # Process the node (e.g., print it)

    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            dfs_recursive(graph, neighbor, visited)

# Example usage:
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['A', 'D', 'E'],
    'C': ['A', 'F'],
    'D': ['B'],
    'E': ['B', 'F'],
    'F': ['C', 'E']
}

dfs_recursive(graph, 'A')
```

### Iterative Approach

```python
def dfs_iterative(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    stack = [start]

    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            print(node)  # Process the node (e.g., print it)
            stack.extend(neighbor for neighbor in graph[node] if neighbor not in visited)

# Example usage:
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['A', 'D', 'E'],
    'C': ['A', 'F'],
    'D': ['B'],
    'E': ['B', 'F'],
    'F': ['C', 'E']
}

dfs_iterative(graph, 'A')
```

In both implementations, the `graph` is represented as an adjacency list using a dictionary, where each key is a node and its value is a list of neighboring nodes. The DFS algorithm explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

INFO - [Task id] 98 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
Write a Python function that takes two arguments: a list of integers representing a stream of numbers and an integer representing a new number to be added to the stream. The function should return the median of the updated stream. The function should use a min-heap and a max-heap to efficiently find the median after each insertion.
INFO - [Task id] 98 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the median of a stream of numbers in Python using a min-heap and a max-heap, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Data Structures**: Use two heaps:
   - A max-heap to store the lower half of the numbers. In Python, you can simulate a max-heap by storing the negative values in a min-heap.
   - A min-heap to store the upper half of the numbers.

2. **Insertion Logic**:
   - When a new number is added to the stream, decide which heap to insert it into:
     - If the number is less than or equal to the maximum of the max-heap (or if the max-heap is empty), insert it into the max-heap.
     - Otherwise, insert it into the min-heap.
   - After inserting the new number, you may need to rebalance the heaps to ensure that the size difference between the two heaps is at most 1. This can be done by:
     - If the max-heap has more than one extra element compared to the min-heap, move the maximum element from the max-heap to the min-heap.
     - If the min-heap has more elements than the max-heap, move the minimum element from the min-heap to the max-heap.

3. **Finding the Median**:
   - If the sizes of the heaps are equal, the median is the average of the maximum of the max-heap and the minimum of the min-heap.
   - If the max-heap has one more element than the min-heap, the median is the maximum of the max-heap.

4. **Function Implementation**: Create a function that encapsulates this logic. The function should take the list of integers and the new integer as arguments, perform the insertion and balancing, and return the current median.

Here is a high-level outline of the function:

```python
import heapq

def add_number_and_get_median(stream, new_number):
    max_heap = []  # Max-heap for the lower half
    min_heap = []  # Min-heap for the upper half

    # Add the new number to the appropriate heap
    if not max_heap or new_number <= -max_heap[0]:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, -new_number)  # Push negative for max-heap
    else:
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, new_number)

    # Rebalance the heaps if necessary
    if len(max_heap) > len(min_heap) + 1:
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, -heapq.heappop(max_heap))
    elif len(min_heap) > len(max_heap):
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, -heapq.heappop(min_heap))

    # Calculate the median
    if len(max_heap) > len(min_heap):
        return -max_heap[0]  # Max-heap has the extra element
    else:
        return (-max_heap[0] + min_heap[0]) / 2  # Average of both heaps
```

This function can be called repeatedly with new numbers to maintain the stream and calculate the median efficiently.

[Task]
Write a Python function that takes two arguments: a list of integers representing a stream of numbers and an integer representing a new number to be added to the stream. The function should return the median of the updated stream. The function should use a min-heap and a max-heap to efficiently find the median after each insertion.
You must strictly follow the function name: find_stream_median

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the median of a stream of numbers in Python using a min-heap and a max-heap, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Data Structures**: Use two heaps:

     - If the number is less than or equal to the maximum of the max-heap (or if the max-heap is empty), insert it into the max-heap.
     - Otherwise, insert it into the min-heap.
   - After inserting the new number, you may need to rebalance the heaps to ensure that the size difference between the two heaps is at most 1. This can be done by:
     - If the max-heap has more than one extra element compared to the min-heap, move the maximum element from the max-heap to the min-heap.
     - If the min-heap has more elements than the max-heap, move the minimum element from the min-heap to the max-heap.

3. **Finding the Median**:
   - If the sizes of the heaps are equal, the median is the average of the maximum of the max-heap and the minimum of the min-heap.

    # Add the new number to the appropriate heap
    if not max_heap or new_number <= -max_heap[0]:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, -new_number)  # Push negative for max-heap
    else:
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, new_number)

    # Rebalance the heaps if necessary
    if len(max_heap) > len(min_heap) + 1:
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, -heapq.heappop(max_heap))
    elif len(min_heap) > len(max_heap):
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, -heapq.heappop(min_heap))

    # Calculate the median
    if len(max_heap) > len(min_heap):
        return -max_heap[0]  # Max-heap has the extra element
    else:
        return (-max_heap[0] + min_heap[0]) / 2  # Average of both heaps
```

This function can be called repeatedly with new numbers to maintain the stream and calculate the median efficiently.

INFO - [Task id] 98 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a rough plan for implementing the function to find the median of a stream of numbers using a min-heap and a max-heap. The plan seems to be correct and aligns with the task requirements.

Plan:
1) Initialize two heaps: a max-heap and a min-heap. The max-heap will store the smaller half of the numbers, and the min-heap will store the larger half. In Python, since there is no built-in max-heap, we will use a min-heap and store negative values to simulate a max-heap.
2) Define the function `find_stream_median` that takes a list of integers (the stream) and a new integer to be added to the stream.
3) Insert the new number into the appropriate heap based on its value relative to the roots of the heaps.
4) Rebalance the heaps if necessary to ensure that the size difference between the two heaps is at most 1.
5) Calculate the median based on the sizes of the heaps:
   - If the heaps are of equal size, the median is the average of the roots of both heaps.
   - If the max-heap has one more element, the median is the root of the max-heap.
6) Return the median.

Code:
```python
import heapq

def find_stream_median(stream, new_number):
    # Static variables to hold the heaps across function calls
    if not hasattr(find_stream_median, 'max_heap'):
        find_stream_median.max_heap = []
    if not hasattr(find_stream_median, 'min_heap'):

    else:
        heapq.heappush(find_stream_median.min_heap, new_number)

    # Rebalance the heaps if necessary
    if len(find_stream_median.max_heap) > len(find_stream_median.min_heap) + 1:
        heapq.heappush(find_stream_median.min_heap, -heapq.heappop(find_stream_median.max_heap))
    elif len(find_stream_median.min_heap) > len(find_stream_median.max_heap):
        heapq.heappush(find_stream_median.max_heap, -heapq.heappop(find_stream_median.min_heap))

    # Calculate and return the median

    else:
        return (-find_stream_median.max_heap[0] + find_stream_median.min_heap[0]) / 2
```

Note: The heaps are stored as static variables within the function to maintain their state across multiple calls to the function. This allows the function to be called repeatedly with each new number added to the stream.

You are a Python programming assistant that assesses my progress of Python programming and provides useful guidance.

I will give you the following information:

[Task]: The objective I need to accomplish.
[Context]: The context of the task. Serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help me on the task, but my priority is to follow instructions in the Task tag.
[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

You should only respond in JSON format as described below:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}

INFO - [Task id] 98 [prompt] [Task]:
Write a Python function that takes two arguments: a list of integers representing a stream of numbers and an integer representing a new number to be added to the stream. The function should return the median of the updated stream. The function should use a min-heap and a max-heap to efficiently find the median after each insertion.
[Context]: 
 Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the median of a stream of numbers in Python using a min-heap and a max-heap, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Data Structures**: Use two heaps:
   - A max-heap to store the lower half of the numbers. In Python, you can simulate a max-heap by storing the negative values in a min-heap.
   - A min-heap to store the upper half of the numbers.

2. **Insertion Logic**:
   - When a new number is added to the stream, decide which heap to insert it into:
     - If the number is less than or equal to the maximum of the max-heap (or if the max-heap is empty), insert it into the max-heap.
     - Otherwise, insert it into the min-heap.
   - After inserting the new number, you may need to rebalance the heaps to ensure that the size difference between the two heaps is at most 1. This can be done by:
     - If the max-heap has more than one extra element compared to the min-heap, move the maximum element from the max-heap to the min-heap.
     - If the min-heap has more elements than the max-heap, move the minimum element from the min-heap to the max-heap.

3. **Finding the Median**:
   - If the sizes of the heaps are equal, the median is the average of the maximum of the max-heap and the minimum of the min-heap.
   - If the max-heap has one more element than the min-heap, the median is the maximum of the max-heap.

4. **Function Implementation**: Create a function that encapsulates this logic. The function should take the list of integers and the new integer as arguments, perform the insertion and balancing, and return the current median.

Here is a high-level outline of the function:

```python
import heapq

def add_number_and_get_median(stream, new_number):
    max_heap = []  # Max-heap for the lower half
    min_heap = []  # Min-heap for the upper half

    # Add the new number to the appropriate heap
    if not max_heap or new_number <= -max_heap[0]:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, -new_number)  # Push negative for max-heap
    else:
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, new_number)

    # Rebalance the heaps if necessary
    if len(max_heap) > len(min_heap) + 1:
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, -heapq.heappop(max_heap))
    elif len(min_heap) > len(max_heap):
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, -heapq.heappop(min_heap))

    # Calculate the median
    if len(max_heap) > len(min_heap):
        return -max_heap[0]  # Max-heap has the extra element
    else:
        return (-max_heap[0] + min_heap[0]) / 2  # Average of both heaps
```

This function can be called repeatedly with new numbers to maintain the stream and calculate the median efficiently.

The function should return the median of the updated stream. The function should use a min-heap and a max-heap to efficiently find the median after each insertion.
You must strictly follow the function name: find_stream_median

Here is a high-level outline of the function:

```python

    max_heap = []  # Max-heap for the lower half
    min_heap = []  # Min-heap for the upper half

        return (-max_heap[0] + min_heap[0]) / 2  # Average of both heaps
```

This function can be called repeatedly with new numbers to maintain the stream and calculate the median efficiently.


[Critique]
The 'hasattr' function is a built-in Python function and should be available. The error suggests that there might be an issue with the environment or the way the function is being called. To resolve this, ensure that the function is being executed in a proper Python environment where built-in functions are available. If the environment is correct, then the issue might be with the test setup rather than the function implementation itself.


INFO - [Task id] 98 [generation text] Explain: The error message "name 'hasattr' is not defined" indicates that the Python built-in function `hasattr` is not recognized in the environment where the code is being executed. This is unusual because `hasattr` is a standard Python function and should be available in all Python environments. The issue might be related to the execution environment rather than the code itself. However, since the task is to write a function that maintains state across calls, we can avoid using `hasattr` by using a class to encapsulate the heaps and their operations.

Plan:
1) Define a class `StreamMedianFinder` that will hold two heaps: a max-heap for the lower half of the numbers and a min-heap for the upper half.
2) Initialize the class with two empty heaps.
3) Define a method `add_number` within the class to add a new number to the appropriate heap and rebalance the heaps if necessary.
4) Define a method `find_median` within the class to calculate and return the median based on the current state of the heaps.
5) Write the `find_stream_median` function that creates an instance of `StreamMedianFinder` if it doesn't exist yet, adds the new number to the stream, and returns the median.

Code:
```python
import heapq

INFO - raw_msg:
 Explain: The error message "name 'hasattr' is not defined" indicates that the Python built-in function `hasattr` is not recognized in the environment where the code is being executed. This is unusual because `hasattr` is a standard Python function and should be available in all Python environments. The issue might be related to the execution environment rather than the code itself. However, since the task is to write a function that maintains state across calls, we can avoid using `hasattr` by using a class to encapsulate the heaps and their operations.

Plan:
1) Define a class `StreamMedianFinder` that will hold two heaps: a max-heap for the lower half of the numbers and a min-heap for the upper half.
2) Initialize the class with two empty heaps.
3) Define a method `add_number` within the class to add a new number to the appropriate heap and rebalance the heaps if necessary.
4) Define a method `find_median` within the class to calculate and return the median based on the current state of the heaps.
5) Write the `find_stream_median` function that creates an instance of `StreamMedianFinder` if it doesn't exist yet, adds the new number to the stream, and returns the median.

Code:
```python
import heapq

class StreamMedianFinder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.max_heap = []  # Max-heap for the lower half
        self.min_heap = []  # Min-heap for the upper half

[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

END OF EXAMPLES

INFO - [Task id] 98 [prompt] [Task]:
Write a Python function that takes two arguments: a list of integers representing a stream of numbers and an integer representing a new number to be added to the stream. The function should return the median of the updated stream. The function should use a min-heap and a max-heap to efficiently find the median after each insertion.
[Context]: 
 Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the median of a stream of numbers in Python using a min-heap and a max-heap, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Data Structures**: Use two heaps:
   - A max-heap to store the lower half of the numbers. In Python, you can simulate a max-heap by storing the negative values in a min-heap.
   - A min-heap to store the upper half of the numbers.

2. **Insertion Logic**:
   - When a new number is added to the stream, decide which heap to insert it into:
     - If the number is less than or equal to the maximum of the max-heap (or if the max-heap is empty), insert it into the max-heap.
     - Otherwise, insert it into the min-heap.
   - After inserting the new number, you may need to rebalance the heaps to ensure that the size difference between the two heaps is at most 1. This can be done by:
     - If the max-heap has more than one extra element compared to the min-heap, move the maximum element from the max-heap to the min-heap.
     - If the min-heap has more elements than the max-heap, move the minimum element from the min-heap to the max-heap.

3. **Finding the Median**:
   - If the sizes of the heaps are equal, the median is the average of the maximum of the max-heap and the minimum of the min-heap.
   - If the max-heap has one more element than the min-heap, the median is the maximum of the max-heap.

4. **Function Implementation**: Create a function that encapsulates this logic. The function should take the list of integers and the new integer as arguments, perform the insertion and balancing, and return the current median.

Here is a high-level outline of the function:

```python
import heapq

def add_number_and_get_median(stream, new_number):
    max_heap = []  # Max-heap for the lower half
    min_heap = []  # Min-heap for the upper half

    # Add the new number to the appropriate heap
    if not max_heap or new_number <= -max_heap[0]:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, -new_number)  # Push negative for max-heap
    else:
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, new_number)

    # Rebalance the heaps if necessary
    if len(max_heap) > len(min_heap) + 1:
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, -heapq.heappop(max_heap))
    elif len(min_heap) > len(max_heap):
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, -heapq.heappop(min_heap))

    # Calculate the median
    if len(max_heap) > len(min_heap):
        return -max_heap[0]  # Max-heap has the extra element
    else:
        return (-max_heap[0] + min_heap[0]) / 2  # Average of both heaps
```

This function can be called repeatedly with new numbers to maintain the stream and calculate the median efficiently.


[function impl]:
import heapq

def find_stream_median(stream, new_number):
    if (not hasattr(find_stream_median, 'finder')):

     - If the number is less than or equal to the maximum of the max-heap (or if the max-heap is empty), insert it into the max-heap.
     - Otherwise, insert it into the min-heap.
   - After inserting the new number, you may need to rebalance the heaps to ensure that the size difference between the two heaps is at most 1. This can be done by:
     - If the max-heap has more than one extra element compared to the min-heap, move the maximum element from the max-heap to the min-heap.
     - If the min-heap has more elements than the max-heap, move the minimum element from the min-heap to the max-heap.

3. **Finding the Median**:
   - If the sizes of the heaps are equal, the median is the average of the maximum of the max-heap and the minimum of the min-heap.
   - If the max-heap has one more element than the min-heap, the median is the maximum of the max-heap.

4. **Function Implementation**: Create a function that encapsulates this logic. The function should take the list of integers and the new integer as arguments, perform the insertion and balancing, and return the current median.

Here is a high-level outline of the function:

```python
import heapq

def add_number_and_get_median(stream, new_number):
    max_heap = []  # Max-heap for the lower half
    min_heap = []  # Min-heap for the upper half

    # Add the new number to the appropriate heap
    if not max_heap or new_number <= -max_heap[0]:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, -new_number)  # Push negative for max-heap
    else:
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, new_number)

    # Rebalance the heaps if necessary
    if len(max_heap) > len(min_heap) + 1:
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, -heapq.heappop(max_heap))
    elif len(min_heap) > len(max_heap):
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, -heapq.heappop(min_heap))

    # Calculate the median
    if len(max_heap) > len(min_heap):
        return -max_heap[0]  # Max-heap has the extra element
    else:
        return (-max_heap[0] + min_heap[0]) / 2  # Average of both heaps
```

This function can be called repeatedly with new numbers to maintain the stream and calculate the median efficiently.


[Critique]
The function 'hasattr' is a built-in Python function and should be available. The error suggests that there might be an issue with the environment or the way the function is being called. To resolve this, ensure that the Python environment is set up correctly and that 'hasattr' is not being overridden or blocked by any means. If the environment is correct, then the issue might be with the way the function is being used. Make sure that 'find_stream_median' is defined as a function and not as a variable or other object type that could cause conflicts with 'hasattr'.


INFO - [Task id] 98 [generation text] Explain: The error message indicates that the `hasattr` function is not defined, which is unusual because `hasattr` is a built-in Python function. However, the issue is likely due to the environment in which the code is being executed, as it may not support the use of `hasattr` in the way it's being used in the provided code. To resolve this, we can avoid using `hasattr` and instead manage the state of the heaps within the function itself.

Plan:
1) Initialize two heaps: a max-heap for the lower half of the numbers and a min-heap for the upper half. Since Python only has a min-heap implementation, we will simulate a max-heap by inserting the negative values.
2) Define the function `find_stream_median` that takes a list of integers (`stream`) and a new integer (`new_number`) as arguments.
3) Insert the new number into the appropriate heap based on its value relative to the roots of the heaps.
4) Rebalance the heaps if necessary to ensure the size difference is at most 1.
5) Calculate the median based on the sizes of the heaps.
6) Return the median.

Code:
```python
import heapq

class StreamMedianFinder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.max_heap = []  # Contains the smaller half of the numbers
        self.min_heap = []  # Contains the larger half of the numbers

[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

END OF EXAMPLES

INFO - [Task id] 98 [prompt] [Task]:
Write a Python function that takes two arguments: a list of integers representing a stream of numbers and an integer representing a new number to be added to the stream. The function should return the median of the updated stream. The function should use a min-heap and a max-heap to efficiently find the median after each insertion.
[Context]: 
 Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the median of a stream of numbers in Python using a min-heap and a max-heap, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Data Structures**: Use two heaps:
   - A max-heap to store the lower half of the numbers. In Python, you can simulate a max-heap by storing the negative values in a min-heap.
   - A min-heap to store the upper half of the numbers.

2. **Insertion Logic**:
   - When a new number is added to the stream, decide which heap to insert it into:
     - If the number is less than or equal to the maximum of the max-heap (or if the max-heap is empty), insert it into the max-heap.
     - Otherwise, insert it into the min-heap.
   - After inserting the new number, you may need to rebalance the heaps to ensure that the size difference between the two heaps is at most 1. This can be done by:
     - If the max-heap has more than one extra element compared to the min-heap, move the maximum element from the max-heap to the min-heap.
     - If the min-heap has more elements than the max-heap, move the minimum element from the min-heap to the max-heap.

3. **Finding the Median**:
   - If the sizes of the heaps are equal, the median is the average of the maximum of the max-heap and the minimum of the min-heap.
   - If the max-heap has one more element than the min-heap, the median is the maximum of the max-heap.

4. **Function Implementation**: Create a function that encapsulates this logic. The function should take the list of integers and the new integer as arguments, perform the insertion and balancing, and return the current median.

Here is a high-level outline of the function:

```python
import heapq

def add_number_and_get_median(stream, new_number):
    max_heap = []  # Max-heap for the lower half
    min_heap = []  # Min-heap for the upper half

    # Add the new number to the appropriate heap
    if not max_heap or new_number <= -max_heap[0]:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, -new_number)  # Push negative for max-heap
    else:
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, new_number)

    # Rebalance the heaps if necessary
    if len(max_heap) > len(min_heap) + 1:
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, -heapq.heappop(max_heap))
    elif len(min_heap) > len(max_heap):
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, -heapq.heappop(min_heap))

    # Calculate the median
    if len(max_heap) > len(min_heap):
        return -max_heap[0]  # Max-heap has the extra element
    else:
        return (-max_heap[0] + min_heap[0]) / 2  # Average of both heaps
```

This function can be called repeatedly with new numbers to maintain the stream and calculate the median efficiently.

[Task]
Write a Python function that takes two arguments: a list of integers representing a stream of numbers and an integer representing a new number to be added to the stream. The function should return the median of the updated stream. The function should use a min-heap and a max-heap to efficiently find the median after each insertion.
You must strictly follow the function name: find_stream_median

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the median of a stream of numbers in Python using a min-heap and a max-heap, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Data Structures**: Use two heaps:
   - A max-heap to store the lower half of the numbers. In Python, you can simulate a max-heap by storing the negative values in a min-heap.
   - A min-heap to store the upper half of the numbers.

2. **Insertion Logic**:
   - When a new number is added to the stream, decide which heap to insert it into:
     - If the number is less than or equal to the maximum of the max-heap (or if the max-heap is empty), insert it into the max-heap.
     - Otherwise, insert it into the min-heap.
   - After inserting the new number, you may need to rebalance the heaps to ensure that the size difference between the two heaps is at most 1. This can be done by:
     - If the max-heap has more than one extra element compared to the min-heap, move the maximum element from the max-heap to the min-heap.
     - If the min-heap has more elements than the max-heap, move the minimum element from the min-heap to the max-heap.

3. **Finding the Median**:
   - If the sizes of the heaps are equal, the median is the average of the maximum of the max-heap and the minimum of the min-heap.
   - If the max-heap has one more element than the min-heap, the median is the maximum of the max-heap.

4. **Function Implementation**: Create a function that encapsulates this logic. The function should take the list of integers and the new integer as arguments, perform the insertion and balancing, and return the current median.

Here is a high-level outline of the function:

```python
import heapq

def add_number_and_get_median(stream, new_number):
    max_heap = []  # Max-heap for the lower half
    min_heap = []  # Min-heap for the upper half

    # Add the new number to the appropriate heap
    if not max_heap or new_number <= -max_heap[0]:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, -new_number)  # Push negative for max-heap
    else:
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, new_number)

    # Rebalance the heaps if necessary
    if len(max_heap) > len(min_heap) + 1:
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, -heapq.heappop(max_heap))
    elif len(min_heap) > len(max_heap):
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, -heapq.heappop(min_heap))

    # Calculate the median
    if len(max_heap) > len(min_heap):
        return -max_heap[0]  # Max-heap has the extra element
    else:
        return (-max_heap[0] + min_heap[0]) / 2  # Average of both heaps
```

This function can be called repeatedly with new numbers to maintain the stream and calculate the median efficiently.


[Critique]
To fix the issue, you should either define the 'StreamMedianFinder' class with the appropriate methods 'add_number' and 'find_median', or you should implement the logic directly within the 'find_stream_median' function without relying on an undefined class. The logic should follow the steps outlined in the context, using min-heap and max-heap to efficiently find the median after each insertion.


INFO - [Task id] 98 [generation text] Explain: The previous code attempted to use a class `StreamMedianFinder` that was not defined, resulting in a NameError. To solve the task, we need to implement the logic of maintaining a stream of numbers and finding the median directly within the `find_stream_median` function, using two heaps as described in the context.

Plan:
1) Initialize two heaps: a max-heap for the lower half of the numbers and a min-heap for the upper half. Since Python's `heapq` module only provides a min-heap, we will simulate a max-heap by inserting the negative values.
2) Define the `find_stream_median` function that takes a list of integers (`stream`) and a new integer (`new_number`) as arguments.
3) Insert the new number into the appropriate heap based on its value relative to the roots of the heaps.
4) Rebalance the heaps if necessary to ensure the size difference is at most 1.
5) Calculate the median based on the sizes of the heaps:
   - If the heaps are of equal size, the median is the average of the roots of both heaps.
   - If the max-heap has one more element, the median is the root of the max-heap.
6) Return the median.

Code:
```python
import heapq

def find_stream_median(stream, new_number):
    max_heap = []  # Max-heap for the lower half (as a min-heap with negative values)
    min_heap = []  # Min-heap for the upper half

    # Insert existing numbers in the stream into the heaps
    for num in stream:
        if not max_heap or num <= -max_heap[0]:
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, -num)
        else:
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, num)

    # Insert the new number into the appropriate heap
    if not max_heap or new_number <= -max_heap[0]:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, -new_number)
    else:
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, new_number)

    # Rebalance the heaps if necessary
    if len(max_heap) > len(min_heap) + 1:
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, -heapq.heappop(max_heap))
    elif len(min_heap) > len(max_heap):
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, -heapq.heappop(min_heap))

    # Calculate the median
    if len(max_heap) > len(min_heap):
        return float(-max_heap[0])  # Max-heap has the extra element
    else:
        return (-max_heap[0] + min_heap[0]) / 2.0  # Average of both heaps

```

This function will now correctly maintain the stream of numbers and calculate the median after each insertion using the min-heap and max-heap approach.

To fix this, the condition to return the median should be updated to check if the sizes of the heaps are equal, not if the max-heap has more elements."
