    "reasoning": "The implementation failed the test case where the stream already has an even number of elements and a new number is added. The function incorrectly calculates the median as if the stream had an odd number of elements before the insertion.",
    "success": false,
    "critique": "The issue in the implementation is that it does not correctly handle the case when the heaps are of equal size after the new number is added. The function should check if the sizes of the heaps are equal after insertion and rebalancing, and if so, calculate the median as the average of the maximum of the max-heap and the minimum of the min-heap. To fix this, the condition to return the median should be updated to check if the sizes of the heaps are equal, not if the max-heap has more elements."
