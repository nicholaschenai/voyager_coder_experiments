You are a helpful assistant that asks questions to help me decide the next immediate task to do for Python programming.
My ultimate goal is to solve as many diverse problems as possible and become the best programmer in the world.

I will give you the following information:
Completed tasks so far: ...
Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should ask at least 5 questions (but no more than 10 questions) to help me decide the next immediate task to do. Each question should be followed by the concept that the question is about.
2) Your question should be specific to a concept in Python programming.
  Bad example (the question is too general):
    Question: What is the best way to program in Python?
    Concept: unknown
  Good example:
    Question: How do you reverse a list?
    Concept: list
3) Your questions should be self-contained and not require any context.

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:

	Write a Python function that takes an integer n and returns the nth number in the 'look-and-say' sequence. The 'look-and-say' sequence starts with '1' and each subsequent term is derived by describing the previous term. For example, the term after '1' is '11' (one 1), after '11' is '21' (two 1s), after '21' is '1211' (one 2, then one 1), and so on. The function should handle n being a positive integer greater than 0.

The function should return a list of nodes in the order they are visited during the BFS traversal.
	Write a Python function that takes a string and returns True if all the characters in the string are unique, and False otherwise. The function should not use any additional data structures like sets or dictionaries.

This is a classic dynamic programming problem where you need to find the least number of perfect square numbers which sum to `n`. For example, given `n = 12`, the answer should be `3` because `12 = 4 + 4 + 4`.
	Write a Python function that takes a string and returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. The function should use the sliding window technique to efficiently solve the problem.

	Write a Python function that takes a string and returns the length of the longest substring with at most two distinct characters. For example, given the string 'aabacbebebe', the longest substring with at most two distinct characters is 'cbebebe', so the function should return 7.

You are a helpful assistant that tells me the next immediate task (in the form of a function) to do for Python programming.

Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. As a rule of thumb, guide me through beginner problems, followed by interview level problems, followed by competitive programming problems. The latter 2 levels can involve concepts from data structures and algorithms.
2) Please be very specific about what skills I need to learn.
3) Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for problems which I have not solved yet. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) The task should involve writing a main Python function that at most use basic libraries (try not to import too many or too advanced modules)
7) Do not give tasks that require file operations (create, read, update, delete) or an internet connection.
8) I am only allowed to write Python functions, so do not require me to write other things (e.g. objects). 
9) Requiring me to write a function that takes in an object and uses object methods is still ok, but I cannot define the objects myself. You must provide the objects as input to my function in the assert statement.

Take note of these in your response:
1) Give an expected function name for the task.
2) Give a tuple of 3 assert statements that tests the function's correctness in the "test_tuple" field. This must strictly contain single-line assert statements only; any setup code for the test must be filled in the "test_setup_code" field.
3) The function name which you gave must be called in the assert statements. 

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}

INFO - [Task id] 92 [prompt] Question 1: How do you implement a binary search algorithm in Python?
Answer: To implement a binary search algorithm in Python, you can use either an iterative or a recursive approach. Below are examples of both methods.

### Iterative Approach

```python
def binary_search_iterative(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To avoid overflow
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Target found
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1  # Search in the right half
        else:
            right = mid - 1  # Search in the left half
            
    return -1  # Target not found
```

### Recursive Approach

```python
def binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, right):
    if left > right:
        return -1  # Target not found
    
    mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To avoid overflow
    
    if arr[mid] == target:
        return mid  # Target found
    elif arr[mid] < target:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, mid + 1, right)  # Search in the right half
    else:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, mid - 1)  # Search in the left half

# To use the recursive function, call it like this:
# result = binary_search_recursive(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
```

### Usage Example

```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
target = 5

# Using iterative approach
result_iterative = binary_search_iterative(arr, target)
print("Iterative result:", result_iterative)

# Using recursive approach
result_recursive = binary_search_recursive(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
print("Recursive result:", result_recursive)
```

Make sure the array is sorted before performing a binary search, as the algorithm assumes a sorted input.

Question 2: How can you find the longest common prefix among a list of strings?
Answer: To find the longest common prefix among a list of strings in Python, you can use the following approach:

1. Check if the list is empty. If it is, return an empty string.
2. Take the first string as a reference and compare it with the other strings.
3. Iterate through the characters of the reference string and check if they match with the corresponding characters of the other strings.
4. Stop when a mismatch is found or when you reach the end of the reference string.

Here is a sample implementation:

```python
def longest_common_prefix(strs):
    if not strs:
        return ""
    
    # Take the first string as the reference
    prefix = strs[0]
    
    for string in strs[1:]:
        # Compare the prefix with each string
        while string[:len(prefix)] != prefix and prefix:
            # Shorten the prefix
            prefix = prefix[:-1]
    
    return prefix

# Example usage
strings = ["flower", "flow", "flight"]
print(longest_common_prefix(strings))  # Output: "fl"
```

This function will return the longest common prefix among the provided list of strings.

Question 3: How do you implement a stack using a list in Python?
Answer: You can implement a stack using a list in Python by utilizing the list's built-in methods. A stack follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Here’s a simple implementation:

```python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.items) == 0

    def push(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)

    def pop(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items.pop()
        else:
            raise IndexError("pop from empty stack")

    def peek(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items[-1]
        else:
            raise IndexError("peek from empty stack")

    def size(self):
        return len(self.items)

# Example usage:
stack = Stack()
stack.push(1)
stack.push(2)
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 2
print(stack.peek())  # Output: 1
print(stack.size())  # Output: 1
```

In this implementation:
- `push(item)` adds an item to the top of the stack.
- `pop()` removes and returns the top item of the stack.
- `peek()` returns the top item without removing it.
- `is_empty()` checks if the stack is empty.
- `size()` returns the number of items in the stack.

Question 4: What is the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy in Python?
Answer: A shallow copy and a deep copy in Python differ in how they handle the copying of objects, particularly when those objects contain references to other objects.

- **Shallow Copy**: A shallow copy creates a new object, but it does not create copies of the objects that are referenced by the original object. Instead, it copies the references to those objects. This means that if the original object contains mutable objects (like lists or dictionaries), changes made to those mutable objects in the shallow copy will also reflect in the original object, and vice versa. You can create a shallow copy using the `copy` module's `copy()` function or by using the `list()` constructor for lists.

  Example:
  ```python
  import copy

  original = [1, 2, [3, 4]]
  shallow_copied = copy.copy(original)

  shallow_copied[2][0] = 'changed'
  print(original)  # Output: [1, 2, ['changed', 4]]
  ```

- **Deep Copy**: A deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all objects found in the original object, meaning that it creates copies of all nested objects as well. This ensures that the new object is completely independent of the original object. You can create a deep copy using the `copy` module's `deepcopy()` function.

  Example:
  ```python
  import copy

  original = [1, 2, [3, 4]]
  deep_copied = copy.deepcopy(original)

  deep_copied[2][0] = 'changed'
  print(original)  # Output: [1, 2, [3, 4]]
  ```

In summary, use a shallow copy when you want to copy the outer object but share references to the inner objects, and use a deep copy when you want to create a completely independent copy of the entire object structure.

Question 5: How do you use the itertools module to generate permutations of a list?
Answer: You can use the `itertools.permutations` function from the `itertools` module to generate all possible permutations of a list in Python. Here’s how you can do it:

```python
import itertools

# Example list
my_list = [1, 2, 3]

# Generate permutations
permutations = itertools.permutations(my_list)

# Convert to a list and print
permuted_list = list(permutations)
print(permuted_list)
```

This will output all the permutations of the list `[1, 2, 3]`, which are:

```
[(1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2), (3, 2, 1)]
```

You can also specify the length of the permutations by passing a second argument to `itertools.permutations`. For example, `itertools.permutations(my_list, 2)` will generate all 2-length permutations of the list.

INFO - [Task id] 92 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
Write a Python function that takes a graph represented as a dictionary where keys are node labels and values are lists of adjacent nodes, and returns a list of nodes in the order they are visited using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. The function should start the DFS from the first node provided in the dictionary.
INFO - [Task id] 92 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of implementing a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function that takes a graph (represented as a dictionary) as an argument.

2. **Initialize Data Structures**: Inside the function, initialize a list to keep track of visited nodes and a list to store the order of visited nodes.

3. **Define the Recursive DFS Function**: Create a helper function that performs the DFS. This function should:
   - Mark the current node as visited by adding it to the visited list.
   - Append the current node to the order of visited nodes.
   - Recursively call itself for each unvisited adjacent node.

4. **Start the DFS**: Call the helper function starting from the first node in the graph (the first key of the dictionary).

5. **Return the Result**: After the DFS completes, return the list of visited nodes in the order they were visited.

Here is a conceptual outline of the code:

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

No code in the first round

[Task]
Write a Python function that takes a graph represented as a dictionary where keys are node labels and values are lists of adjacent nodes, and returns a list of nodes in the order they are visited using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. The function should start the DFS from the first node provided in the dictionary.
You must strictly follow the function name: depth_first_search

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of implementing a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function that takes a graph (represented as a dictionary) as an argument.

2. **Initialize Data Structures**: Inside the function, initialize a list to keep track of visited nodes and a list to store the order of visited nodes.

3. **Define the Recursive DFS Function**: Create a helper function that performs the DFS. This function should:
   - Mark the current node as visited by adding it to the visited list.
   - Append the current node to the order of visited nodes.
   - Recursively call itself for each unvisited adjacent node.

4. **Start the DFS**: Call the helper function starting from the first node in the graph (the first key of the dictionary).

5. **Return the Result**: After the DFS completes, return the list of visited nodes in the order they were visited.

Here is a conceptual outline of the code:

```python
def dfs(graph):
    visited = []  # List to keep track of visited nodes
    order = []    # List to store the order of visited nodes

    def dfs_helper(node):
        if node not in visited:
            visited.append(node)  # Mark the node as visited
            order.append(node)    # Add the node to the order
            for neighbor in graph[node]:  # Explore each adjacent node
                dfs_helper(neighbor)  # Recursive call for unvisited neighbors

    # Start DFS from the first node in the graph
    if graph:  # Check if the graph is not empty
        start_node = next(iter(graph))  # Get the first node
        dfs_helper(start_node)

    return order  # Return the order of visited nodes
```

This function will perform a DFS traversal starting from the first node in the graph and return the nodes in the order they were visited.

[Context]: The context of the task. Serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help me on the task, but my priority is to follow instructions in the Task tag.
[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

[Task]
Write a Python function that takes a graph represented as a dictionary where keys are node labels and values are lists of adjacent nodes, and returns a list of nodes in the order they are visited using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. The function should start the DFS from the first node provided in the dictionary.
You must strictly follow the function name: depth_first_search

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of implementing a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function that takes a graph (represented as a dictionary) as an argument.

2. **Initialize Data Structures**: Inside the function, initialize a list to keep track of visited nodes and a list to store the order of visited nodes.

3. **Define the Recursive DFS Function**: Create a helper function that performs the DFS. This function should:
   - Mark the current node as visited by adding it to the visited list.
   - Append the current node to the order of visited nodes.
   - Recursively call itself for each unvisited adjacent node.

4. **Start the DFS**: Call the helper function starting from the first node in the graph (the first key of the dictionary).

5. **Return the Result**: After the DFS completes, return the list of visited nodes in the order they were visited.

Here is a conceptual outline of the code:

```python
def dfs(graph):
    visited = []  # List to keep track of visited nodes
    order = []    # List to store the order of visited nodes

    def dfs_helper(node):
        if node not in visited:
            visited.append(node)  # Mark the node as visited
            order.append(node)    # Add the node to the order
            for neighbor in graph[node]:  # Explore each adjacent node
                dfs_helper(neighbor)  # Recursive call for unvisited neighbors

    # Start DFS from the first node in the graph
    if graph:  # Check if the graph is not empty
        start_node = next(iter(graph))  # Get the first node
        dfs_helper(start_node)

    return order  # Return the order of visited nodes
```

This function will perform a DFS traversal starting from the first node in the graph and return the nodes in the order they were visited.


[Critique]
To fix the issue, the function should iterate over all nodes in the graph and perform DFS starting from each unvisited node. This ensures that all disconnected components of the graph are visited. Modify the function to include a loop that goes through all nodes in the graph dictionary and calls dfs_helper for each unvisited node.


INFO - [Task id] 92 [generation text] Explain: The provided code fails to visit all nodes in the graph when the graph is not fully connected. The DFS is only initiated from the first node in the dictionary, which means that any nodes not connected to this node will not be visited.

Plan:
1) Modify the `depth_first_search` function to iterate over all nodes in the graph.
2) For each node, if it has not been visited, call the `dfs_helper` function to perform a DFS starting from that node.
3) This will ensure that all disconnected components of the graph are visited.
4) Return the list of visited nodes in the order they were visited.

[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)
