    "reasoning": "The implementation correctly performs a DFS traversal and returns the nodes in the order they were visited. It handles the case where the graph might have multiple disconnected components by iterating over all nodes and starting a DFS from each unvisited node. The unit tests cover various scenarios, including a connected graph, a simple two-node graph, and a graph with no edges, and the function passes all of them.",
    "success": true,
    "critique": "The function implementation meets the task requirements. However, it's important to note that the function may not always start the DFS from the first node provided in the dictionary due to the nature of dictionaries in Python 3.6 and earlier, where the order of keys is not guaranteed. From Python 3.7 onwards, dictionaries maintain insertion order. If the task requires starting from the first node provided in the dictionary, the implementation should explicitly start the DFS from the first key in the sorted list of keys or clarify the version of Python being used."
