    "success": true,
    "critique": "While the function passes all the given tests, it's important to consider edge cases that were not tested, such as very large lists, lists with large gaps between numbers, or lists with duplicates. The current implementation is efficient for the tested cases, but performance could be an issue with very large input lists. No changes are suggested at this time, but additional tests could be considered to ensure robustness."
