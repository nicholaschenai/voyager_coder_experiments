    "critique": "The function implementation meets the task requirements. However, the base case can be set to when n is 1 instead of 0 for this specific task, as the sum of integers from 1 to 1 is 1. This is more aligned with the typical mathematical definition of the sum of the first n natural numbers. The current implementation is still correct, but adjusting the base case to n == 1 would be a minor improvement to better match the task description."
