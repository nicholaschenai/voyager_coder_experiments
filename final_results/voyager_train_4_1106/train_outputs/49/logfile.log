You are a helpful assistant that asks questions to help me decide the next immediate task to do for Python programming.
My ultimate goal is to solve as many diverse problems as possible and become the best programmer in the world.

I will give you the following information:
Completed tasks so far: ...
Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should ask at least 5 questions (but no more than 10 questions) to help me decide the next immediate task to do. Each question should be followed by the concept that the question is about.
2) Your question should be specific to a concept in Python programming.

	Write a Python function that takes a string containing only '(', ')', '[', ']', '{', and '}', and determines if the input string has balanced parentheses, brackets, and braces. A string is balanced if all types of brackets are correctly closed and nested. The function should return True if the string is balanced, and False otherwise.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list with each integer replaced by the greatest integer to the right of that integer in the original list. For the last element, replace it with -1. The function should not modify the original list.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of the unique numbers in that list. For example, if the input list is [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4], the function should return 1 + 3 = 4.

You are a helpful assistant that tells me the next immediate task (in the form of a function) to do for Python programming. 
My ultimate goal is to solve as many diverse problems as possible and become the best programmer in the world.

Completed tasks so far: ...
Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. As a rule of thumb, guide me through beginner problems, followed by interview level problems, followed by competitive programming problems. The latter 2 levels can involve concepts from data structures and algorithms.
2) Please be very specific about what skills I need to learn.
3) Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for problems which I have not solved yet. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) The task should involve writing a main Python function that at most use basic libraries (try not to import too many or too advanced modules)
7) Do not give tasks that require file operations (create, read, update, delete) or an internet connection.
8) I am only allowed to write Python functions, so do not require me to write other things (e.g. objects). 
9) Requiring me to write a function that takes in an object and uses object methods is still ok, but I cannot define the objects myself. You must provide the objects as input to my function in the assert statement.

Take note of these in your response:
1) Give an expected function name for the task.
2) Give a tuple of 3 assert statements that tests the function's correctness in the "test_tuple" field. This must strictly contain single-line assert statements only; any setup code for the test must be filled in the "test_setup_code" field.
3) The function name which you gave must be called in the assert statements. 

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.

    ]
}

INFO - [Task id] 49 [prompt] Question 1: How do you implement a binary search algorithm in Python?
Answer: To implement a binary search algorithm in Python, you can use either an iterative or a recursive approach. Below are examples of both methods.

### Iterative Approach

```python
def binary_search_iterative(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To avoid overflow
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Target found
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1  # Search in the right half
        else:
            right = mid - 1  # Search in the left half
            
    return -1  # Target not found
```

### Recursive Approach

```python
def binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, right):
    if left > right:
        return -1  # Target not found
    
    mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To avoid overflow
    
    if arr[mid] == target:
        return mid  # Target found
    elif arr[mid] < target:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, mid + 1, right)  # Search in the right half
    else:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, mid - 1)  # Search in the left half

# To use the recursive function, call it like this:
# result = binary_search_recursive(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
```

### Usage Example

```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
target = 5

# Using iterative approach
result_iterative = binary_search_iterative(arr, target)
print("Iterative result:", result_iterative)

# Using recursive approach
result_recursive = binary_search_recursive(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
print("Recursive result:", result_recursive)
```

Make sure the array is sorted before performing a binary search, as the algorithm assumes a sorted input.

Question 2: What is the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy in Python?
Answer: A shallow copy and a deep copy in Python differ in how they handle the copying of objects, particularly when those objects contain references to other objects.

- **Shallow Copy**: A shallow copy creates a new object, but it does not create copies of the objects that are referenced by the original object. Instead, it copies the references to those objects. This means that if the original object contains mutable objects (like lists or dictionaries), changes made to those mutable objects in the shallow copy will also reflect in the original object, and vice versa. You can create a shallow copy using the `copy` module's `copy()` function or by using the `list()` constructor for lists.

  Example:
  ```python
  import copy

  original = [1, 2, [3, 4]]
  shallow_copied = copy.copy(original)

  shallow_copied[2][0] = 'changed'
  print(original)  # Output: [1, 2, ['changed', 4]]
  ```

- **Deep Copy**: A deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all objects found in the original object, meaning that it creates copies of all nested objects as well. This ensures that the new object is completely independent of the original object. You can create a deep copy using the `copy` module's `deepcopy()` function.

  Example:
  ```python
  import copy

  original = [1, 2, [3, 4]]
  deep_copied = copy.deepcopy(original)

  deep_copied[2][0] = 'changed'
  print(original)  # Output: [1, 2, [3, 4]]
  ```

In summary, use a shallow copy when you want to copy the outer object but share references to the inner objects, and use a deep copy when you want to create a completely independent copy of the entire object structure.

Question 3: How can you use list comprehensions to create a new list based on an existing list?
Answer: You can use list comprehensions in Python to create a new list by applying an expression to each item in an existing list. The syntax for a list comprehension is:

```python
new_list = [expression for item in existing_list if condition]
```

Here, `expression` is the operation you want to perform on each `item`, `existing_list` is the list you are iterating over, and `condition` is an optional filter that allows you to include only certain items in the new list.

For example, if you have a list of numbers and you want to create a new list containing the squares of those numbers, you can do it like this:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = [x**2 for x in numbers]
```

This will result in `squared_numbers` being `[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]`. If you want to include only the squares of even numbers, you can add a condition:

```python
even_squared_numbers = [x**2 for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]
```

This will result in `even_squared_numbers` being `[4, 16]`.

Question 4: What are decorators in Python and how do you use them?
Answer: Decorators in Python are a powerful and flexible way to modify or enhance the behavior of functions or methods. They are essentially functions that take another function as an argument and extend or alter its behavior without explicitly modifying it.

To use a decorator, you typically define a function that wraps another function. Here’s a simple example of how to create and use a decorator:

1. **Define a Decorator**: A decorator is defined as a function that takes another function as an argument.

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper
```

2. **Apply the Decorator**: You can apply the decorator to a function using the `@decorator_name` syntax above the function definition.

```python
@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

# Calling the decorated function
say_hello()
```

When you call `say_hello()`, the output will be:

```
Something is happening before the function is called.
Hello!
Something is happening after the function is called.
```

3. **Using Decorators with Arguments**: If you want to create a decorator that accepts arguments, you can nest another function inside the decorator.

```python
def repeat(num_times):
    def decorator_repeat(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            for _ in range(num_times):
                func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator_repeat

@repeat(3)
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Calling the decorated function
greet("Alice")
```

This will print "Hello, Alice!" three times.

In summary, decorators are a way to modify the behavior of functions or methods in a clean and readable manner, allowing for code reuse and separation of concerns.

Question 5: How can you handle exceptions in Python using try and except?
Answer: In Python, you can handle exceptions using the `try` and `except` blocks. The code that might raise an exception is placed inside the `try` block, and the code that handles the exception is placed inside the `except` block. Here’s a basic example:

```python
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
    result = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
except ZeroDivisionError:
    # Code that runs if a ZeroDivisionError occurs
    print("You cannot divide by zero!")
except Exception as e:
    # Code that runs for any other exception
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
else:
    # Code that runs if no exception occurs
    print(f"The result is {result}")
finally:
    # Code that runs no matter what (optional)
    print("Execution completed.")
```

In this example:
- The `try` block contains code that may raise an exception.
- The `except` block catches specific exceptions (like `ZeroDivisionError`) and handles them.
- The `else` block runs if no exceptions were raised in the `try` block.
- The `finally` block runs regardless of whether an exception occurred or not, which is useful for cleanup actions.

Completed tasks so far (do not give me these tasks again!): 
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list with the squares of all the numbers. The function should not modify the original list.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the unique elements from the original list. The order of elements in the returned list does not matter.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a set containing all the elements that appear more than once in the list.
	Write a Python function that calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It is denoted by n!.
	Write a Python function that takes a string and returns True if the string is a palindrome, and False otherwise. The function should be case-insensitive and ignore all non-alphanumeric characters.
	Write a Python function that takes a dictionary and a key, and returns the value associated with the key. If the key does not exist in the dictionary, the function should return 'Key not found.'

	Write a Python function that takes a non-negative integer n and returns the nth number in the 'look-and-say' sequence. The 'look-and-say' sequence starts with '1' and each subsequent term is derived by describing the previous term. For example, the term after '1' is '11' (one 1), after '11' is '21' (two 1s), after '21' is '1211' (one 2, then one 1), and so on.

	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list with the integers sorted in ascending order using the insertion sort algorithm. The function should not modify the original list.
	Write a Python function that takes a string containing only '(', ')', '[', ']', '{', and '}', and determines if the input string has balanced parentheses, brackets, and braces. A string is balanced if all types of brackets are correctly closed and nested. The function should return True if the string is balanced, and False otherwise.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list with each integer replaced by the greatest integer to the right of that integer in the original list. For the last element, replace it with -1. The function should not modify the original list.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of the unique numbers in that list. For example, if the input list is [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4], the function should return 1 + 3 = 4.
	Write a Python function that takes a string and returns a dictionary where the keys are characters and the values are the number of times each character appears in the string. The function should ignore case and consider only alphabetic characters.
	Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the index of the peak element. A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.

INFO - [Task id] 49 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a dictionary where the keys are the integers and the values are the counts of how often each integer appears in the list.
INFO - [Task id] 49 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of counting the occurrences of integers in a list and returning a dictionary with the integers as keys and their counts as values, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a list of integers as an argument.

2. **Initialize a Dictionary**: Create an empty dictionary that will hold the integers as keys and their counts as values.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to go through each integer in the list.

4. **Count Occurrences**: For each integer, check if it is already a key in the dictionary:
   - If it is, increment its count by 1.
   - If it is not, add it to the dictionary with a count of 1.

5. **Return the Dictionary**: After processing all integers in the list, return the dictionary.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps in Python:

```python
def count_integers(int_list):
    count_dict = {}
    for num in int_list:
        if num in count_dict:
            count_dict[num] += 1
        else:
            count_dict[num] = 1
    return count_dict
```

This function will effectively count how many times each integer appears in the provided list and return the results in a dictionary format.

[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

    "critique": "The issue stems from the while loop while current_sum + nums[right] <= target:, which directly accesses nums[right] without checking if right is within the bounds of the list. This results in a runtime error when right goes beyond the list length. To overcome this error, we need to add a bounds check for the right variable in the mentioned while loop. We can modify the loop condition to while right < len(nums) and current_sum + nums[right] <= target:. This change will ensure that we only access elements within the bounds of the list, thus avoiding the IndexError."

INFO - [Task id] 49 [prompt] [Task]:
Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a dictionary where the keys are the integers and the values are the counts of how often each integer appears in the list.
[Context]: 
 Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of counting the occurrences of integers in a list and returning a dictionary with the integers as keys and their counts as values, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a list of integers as an argument.

2. **Initialize a Dictionary**: Create an empty dictionary that will hold the integers as keys and their counts as values.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to go through each integer in the list.

4. **Count Occurrences**: For each integer, check if it is already a key in the dictionary:
   - If it is, increment its count by 1.
   - If it is not, add it to the dictionary with a count of 1.

5. **Return the Dictionary**: After processing all integers in the list, return the dictionary.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps in Python:

```python
def count_integers(int_list):
    count_dict = {}
    for num in int_list:
        if num in count_dict:
            count_dict[num] += 1
        else:
            count_dict[num] = 1
    return count_dict
```

This function will effectively count how many times each integer appears in the provided list and return the results in a dictionary format.

def count_integers(int_list):
    count_dict = {}
    for num in int_list:
        if (num in count_dict):
            count_dict[num] += 1
        else:
            count_dict[num] = 1
    return count_dict

The main function is `count_integers`.
INFO - [Task id] 49 [generation text] This function takes a list of integers as input and counts the occurrences of each integer in the list. It initializes an empty dictionary to store the counts. As it iterates through the list, it updates the count for each integer, either by incrementing the existing count or initializing it to one if the integer is encountered for the first time. Finally, it returns the dictionary containing the integers and their corresponding counts. This allows for a quick overview of how many times each integer appears in the input list. The function effectively provides a frequency distribution of the integers.
