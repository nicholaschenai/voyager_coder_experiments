    "success": true,
    "critique": "While the function implementation passed the unit tests, it relies on a function 'find_kth_largest' which is not provided. If this function modifies the original list or is inefficient, it could be problematic. To ensure the original list is not modified and to potentially improve efficiency, consider using a different approach such as sorting a copy of the list and then summing the two largest elements, as described in the context."
