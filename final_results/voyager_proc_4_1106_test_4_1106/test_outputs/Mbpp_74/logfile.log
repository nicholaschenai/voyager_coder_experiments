"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/74 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of checking whether two lists follow the same pattern, you can create a function that maps each unique element in the first list to a unique element in the second list. The function should ensure that the mapping is consistent throughout both lists.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of how to implement this:

1. **Check Lengths**: First, ensure that both lists have the same length. If they don't, return `False`.

2. **Create Mappings**: Use two dictionaries to keep track of the mappings:
   - One dictionary to map elements from the first list to elements in the second list.
   - Another dictionary to map elements from the second list back to elements in the first list.

3. **Iterate and Map**: Loop through the elements of both lists simultaneously:
   - For each pair of elements (one from the first list and one from the second), check if they are already mapped.
   - If they are not mapped, create a new mapping in both dictionaries.
   - If they are already mapped, ensure that the existing mapping is consistent with the current pair.

4. **Return Result**: If you complete the loop without inconsistencies, return `True`. If you find any inconsistencies, return `False`.

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of the above logic:

```python
def is_samepatterns(patterns, values):
    if len(patterns) != len(values):
        return False
    
    pattern_to_value = {}
    value_to_pattern = {}
    
    for p, v in zip(patterns, values):
        if p in pattern_to_value:
            if pattern_to_value[p] != v:
                return False
        else:
            pattern_to_value[p] = v
        
        if v in value_to_pattern:
            if value_to_pattern[v] != p:
                return False
        else:
            value_to_pattern[v] = p
            
    return True

# Example usage
assert is_samepatterns(["red", "green", "green"], ["a", "b", "b"]) == True
```

This function checks if the two lists follow the same pattern by ensuring that the relationships between the elements are consistent.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
