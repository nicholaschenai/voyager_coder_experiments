INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/145 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array.
assert max_Abs_Diff((2,1,5,3)) == 4
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/145 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Identify the Elements**: Understand that the maximum difference between any two elements in an array can be found by identifying the largest and smallest elements in that array.

2. **Calculate the Difference**: The maximum difference will be the difference between the maximum element and the minimum element.

3. **Implement the Function**: You can create a function that takes an array (or tuple) as input, uses the built-in `max()` and `min()` functions to find the largest and smallest values, and then returns the difference between these two values.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual outline of the function:

- Define a function named `max_Abs_Diff` that takes a single argument (the array).
- Use the `max()` function to find the maximum value in the array.
- Use the `min()` function to find the minimum value in the array.
- Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum values.
- Return this difference.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic:

```python
def max_Abs_Diff(arr):
    return max(arr) - min(arr)

# Example usage
assert max_Abs_Diff((2, 1, 5, 3)) == 4
```

This function will correctly compute the maximum difference for the provided example.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Identify the Elements**: Understand that the maximum difference between any two elements in an array can be found by identifying the largest and smallest elements in that array.

2. **Calculate the Difference**: The maximum difference will be the difference between the maximum element and the minimum element.
