INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/105 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a python function to count true booleans in the given list.
assert count([True,False,True]) == 2
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/105 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of counting the number of `True` boolean values in a given list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function named `count` that takes a list as an argument.

2. **Initialize a Counter**: Inside the function, initialize a counter variable to zero. This variable will keep track of the number of `True` values.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to iterate through each element in the list. For each element, check if it is `True`.

4. **Update the Counter**: If an element is `True`, increment the counter by one.

5. **Return the Count**: After the loop has finished, return the value of the counter.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def count(bool_list):
    count_true = 0
    for value in bool_list:
        if value is True:
            count_true += 1
    return count_true
```

You can then use the `assert` statement to verify that the function works as expected:

```python
assert count([True, False, True]) == 2
```

This will check that the function correctly counts the number of `True` values in the list.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
