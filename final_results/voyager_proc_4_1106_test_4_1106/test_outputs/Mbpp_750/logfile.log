"""
Write a function to add the given tuple to the given list.
assert add_tuple([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == [5, 6, 7, 9, 10]
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/750 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of adding a given tuple to a list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function named `add_tuple` that takes two parameters: a list and a tuple.

2. **Extend the List**: Use the list's `extend()` method or the `+=` operator to add the elements of the tuple to the list. The `extend()` method allows you to add multiple elements from an iterable (like a tuple) to the end of the list.

3. **Return the Modified List**: After adding the elements from the tuple, return the modified list.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def add_tuple(lst, tup):
    # Extend the list with the elements of the tuple
    lst.extend(tup)
    # Return the modified list
    return lst
```

In this function, when you call `add_tuple([5, 6, 7], (9, 10))`, it will modify the list to include the elements from the tuple, resulting in `[5, 6, 7, 9, 10]`. The `assert` statement checks that the function works as expected.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
