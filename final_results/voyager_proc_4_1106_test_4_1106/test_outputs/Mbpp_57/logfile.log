"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/57 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the largest number that can be formed with a given list of digits in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Convert Digits to Strings**: Since you want to concatenate the digits to form the largest number, it's easier to work with them as strings.

2. **Sort the Digits**: You need to sort the list of string digits in a way that when concatenated, they form the largest possible number. This can be done by defining a custom sorting rule. For two digits `x` and `y`, you should compare the concatenated results of `x+y` and `y+x`. If `x+y` is greater, then `x` should come before `y` in the sorted order.

3. **Join the Sorted Digits**: After sorting the digits based on the custom rule, you can join them together to form the final largest number.

4. **Convert Back to Integer**: If needed, convert the resulting string back to an integer to match the expected output format.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def find_Max_Num(digits):
    # Step 1: Convert digits to strings
    str_digits = list(map(str, digits))
    
    # Step 2: Sort the digits based on the custom rule
    str_digits.sort(key=lambda x: x*10, reverse=True)  # Multiply by 10 to ensure proper comparison
    
    # Step 3: Join the sorted digits
    largest_num_str = ''.join(str_digits)
    
    # Step 4: Convert to integer (if needed)
    return int(largest_num_str)
```

This function will return the largest number that can be formed from the given list of digits. The use of `x*10` in the sorting key is a simple trick to ensure that the comparison works correctly for all digit combinations.

    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests

Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the largest number that can be formed with a given list of digits in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Convert Digits to Strings**: Since you want to concatenate the digits to form the largest number, it's easier to work with them as strings.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python

    str_digits = list(map(str, digits))
    
    # Step 2: Sort the digits based on the custom rule

    largest_num_str = ''.join(str_digits)
    
    # Step 4: Convert to integer (if needed)
    return int(largest_num_str)
```

This function will return the largest number that can be formed from the given list of digits. The use of `x*10` in the sorting key is a simple trick to ensure that the comparison works correctly for all digit combinations.

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the largest number that can be formed with a given list of digits in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Convert Digits to Strings**: Since you want to concatenate the digits to form the largest number, it's easier to work with them as strings.

2. **Sort the Digits**: You need to sort the list of string digits in a way that when concatenated, they form the largest possible number. This can be done by defining a custom sorting rule. For two digits `x` and `y`, you should compare the concatenated results of `x+y` and `y+x`. If `x+y` is greater, then `x` should come before `y` in the sorted order.

3. **Join the Sorted Digits**: After sorting the digits based on the custom rule, you can join them together to form the final largest number.

4. **Convert Back to Integer**: If needed, convert the resulting string back to an integer to match the expected output format.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def find_Max_Num(digits):
    # Step 1: Convert digits to strings
    str_digits = list(map(str, digits))
    
    # Step 2: Sort the digits based on the custom rule
    str_digits.sort(key=lambda x: x*10, reverse=True)  # Multiply by 10 to ensure proper comparison
    
    # Step 3: Join the sorted digits
    largest_num_str = ''.join(str_digits)
    
    # Step 4: Convert to integer (if needed)
    return int(largest_num_str)
```

This function will return the largest number that can be formed from the given list of digits. The use of `x*10` in the sorting key is a simple trick to ensure that the comparison works correctly for all digit combinations.


[Critique]
The compare function is incorrectly returning the result of a boolean expression instead of -1, 0, or 1. The subtraction operation between a string and a boolean is not valid in Python. To fix this, the compare function should return -1 if x+y is greater than y+x, 1 if y+x is greater, or 0 if they are equal. This can be achieved by returning (y+x).compare(x+y) if using Python 2, or simply returning ((y+x) > (x+y)) - ((y+x) < (x+y)) in Python 3.


INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/57 [generation text] Explain: The critique correctly identifies the issue with the compare function. The compare function should return an integer value, not a boolean. The subtraction of a boolean from a string is not valid in Python, and the compare function should return -1, 0, or 1 to indicate the ordering of the two items being compared.

Plan:
1) Define the function `find_Max_Num` that takes a list of integers as an argument.
2) Convert each integer in the list to a string so that they can be concatenated.
3) Define a custom comparison function that compares two strings based on the concatenation of them in both possible orders.
4) Sort the list of string digits using the custom comparison function.
5) Concatenate the sorted list of string digits into one string.
6) Convert the concatenated string back to an integer.
7) Return the integer.

Code:
```python
from functools import cmp_to_key

def find_Max_Num(digits):
    # Convert digits to strings
    str_digits = list(map(str, digits))
    
    # Define a custom comparison function

[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

Write a python function to find the largest number that can be formed with the given list of digits.
assert find_Max_Num([1,2,3]) == 321
"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the largest number that can be formed with a given list of digits in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Convert Digits to Strings**: Since you want to concatenate the digits to form the largest number, it's easier to work with them as strings.

2. **Sort the Digits**: You need to sort the list of string digits in a way that when concatenated, they form the largest possible number. This can be done by defining a custom sorting rule. For two digits `x` and `y`, you should compare the concatenated results of `x+y` and `y+x`. If `x+y` is greater, then `x` should come before `y` in the sorted order.

3. **Join the Sorted Digits**: After sorting the digits based on the custom rule, you can join them together to form the final largest number.

4. **Convert Back to Integer**: If needed, convert the resulting string back to an integer to match the expected output format.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def find_Max_Num(digits):
    # Step 1: Convert digits to strings
    str_digits = list(map(str, digits))
    
    # Step 2: Sort the digits based on the custom rule
    str_digits.sort(key=lambda x: x*10, reverse=True)  # Multiply by 10 to ensure proper comparison
    
    # Step 3: Join the sorted digits
    largest_num_str = ''.join(str_digits)
    
    # Step 4: Convert to integer (if needed)
    return int(largest_num_str)
```

This function will return the largest number that can be formed from the given list of digits. The use of `x*10` in the sorting key is a simple trick to ensure that the comparison works correctly for all digit combinations.


[Critique]
The issue in the implementation is that the 'reverse=True' parameter in the sort function is causing the digits to be sorted in ascending order when combined, which is the opposite of what is needed. To fix this, we should remove the 'reverse=True' parameter from the sort function call, as the compare function already handles the ordering correctly by returning -1 when x+y is greater than y+x, which will sort the digits in the desired descending order.


INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/57 [generation text] Explain: The critique correctly identifies the issue with the 'reverse=True' parameter in the sort function. The custom comparison function already ensures that the digits are sorted in such a way that their concatenation forms the largest number. Therefore, the 'reverse=True' parameter is not needed and should be removed.

Plan:
1) Define the function `find_Max_Num` that takes a list of digits as input.
2) Convert the list of digits to a list of strings to facilitate comparison.
3) Define a custom comparison function that compares two digits based on the concatenation of their string representations in both possible orders.
4) Sort the list of string digits using the custom comparison function without reversing the order.
5) Join the sorted string digits to form the largest number.
6) Convert the joined string back to an integer.
7) Return the integer.

Code:
```python
from functools import cmp_to_key

def find_Max_Num(digits):
    # Convert digits to strings
    str_digits = list(map(str, digits))

    # Custom comparison function
    def compare(x, y):
        if (x + y) > (y + x):
            return -1
        elif (x + y) < (y + x):
            return 1
        else:
            return 0

    # Sort the list of string digits using the custom comparison function
    str_digits.sort(key=cmp_to_key(compare))

    # Join the sorted string digits to form the largest number
    largest_num_str = ''.join(str_digits)

    # Convert the joined string back to an integer
    return int(largest_num_str)
