Write a function to check if given tuple contains no duplicates.

"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/394 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of checking if a given tuple contains no duplicates in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function named `check_distinct` that takes a tuple as an argument.

2. **Convert to Set**: Inside the function, convert the tuple to a set. A set is a data structure that automatically removes duplicate values, so this will help in identifying if there were any duplicates in the original tuple.

3. **Compare Lengths**: Compare the length of the original tuple with the length of the set. If the lengths are the same, it means there are no duplicates; if the length of the set is less than the length of the tuple, it indicates that duplicates were present.

4. **Return Result**: Return `True` if there are no duplicates (lengths are equal) and `False` if there are duplicates (length of set is less).

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def check_distinct(tup):
    return len(tup) == len(set(tup))
```

This function will return `False` for the provided assertion `check_distinct((1, 4, 5, 6, 1, 4))` since there are duplicates in the tuple.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

Answer: To accomplish the task of checking if a given tuple contains no duplicates in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function named `check_distinct` that takes a tuple as an argument.

2. **Convert to Set**: Inside the function, convert the tuple to a set. A set is a data structure that automatically removes duplicate values, so this will help in identifying if there were any duplicates in the original tuple.

This function will return `False` for the provided assertion `check_distinct((1, 4, 5, 6, 1, 4))` since there are duplicates in the tuple.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/394 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan for implementing the function `check_distinct`. By converting the tuple to a set, we can easily check for duplicates since a set in Python does not allow duplicate elements. If the length of the set is equal to the length of the tuple, it means there were no duplicates in the tuple. Otherwise, if the length of the set is less than the length of the tuple, it indicates that there were duplicates.

Plan:
1) Define the function `check_distinct` that takes a tuple as its argument.
2) Inside the function, convert the tuple to a set.
3) Compare the length of the original tuple with the length of the set.
4) Return `True` if the lengths are equal (no duplicates), otherwise return `False`.

Code:
```python
def check_distinct(tup):
    # Convert the tuple to a set to remove duplicates
    unique_elements = set(tup)
    # Compare the length of the original tuple and the set
    return len(tup) == len(unique_elements)
