INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/773 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
assert occurance_substring('python programming, python language','python')==('python', 0, 6)
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/773 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the occurrence and position of a substring within a string in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `occurance_substring` that takes two parameters: the main string and the substring you want to search for.

2. **Search for the Substring**: Use the string method `find()` to locate the first occurrence of the substring within the main string. This method returns the index of the first occurrence or `-1` if the substring is not found.

3. **Check for Matches**: If the result from `find()` is `-1`, return `None` to indicate that there is no match.

4. **Return the Result**: If a match is found, return a tuple containing the substring and its starting and ending positions. The starting position is the index returned by `find()`, and the ending position can be calculated by adding the length of the substring to the starting position.

5. **Consider Edge Cases**: Ensure that your function handles cases where the substring appears multiple times, but for this specific task, you only need the first occurrence.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def occurance_substring(main_string, substring):
    start_index = main_string.find(substring)
    if start_index == -1:
        return None
    end_index = start_index + len(substring)
    return (substring, start_index, end_index)
```

This function will return the expected output as specified in the assertion.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the occurrence and position of a substring within a string in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `occurance_substring` that takes two parameters: the main string and the substring you want to search for.

2. **Search for the Substring**: Use the string method `find()` to locate the first occurrence of the substring within the main string. This method returns the index of the first occurrence or `-1` if the substring is not found.

3. **Check for Matches**: If the result from `find()` is `-1`, return `None` to indicate that there is no match.

4. **Return the Result**: If a match is found, return a tuple containing the substring and its starting and ending positions. The starting position is the index returned by `find()`, and the ending position can be calculated by adding the length of the substring to the starting position.

5. **Consider Edge Cases**: Ensure that your function handles cases where the substring appears multiple times, but for this specific task, you only need the first occurrence.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def occurance_substring(main_string, substring):
    start_index = main_string.find(substring)
    if start_index == -1:
        return None
    end_index = start_index + len(substring)
    return (substring, start_index, end_index)
```

This function will return the expected output as specified in the assertion.
