"""
Write a python function to check whether the two numbers differ at one bit position only or not.
assert differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(13,9) == True
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/6 [generation text] Answer: To determine if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **XOR Operation**: Use the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) to compare the two numbers. The XOR operation will yield a number that has bits set to `1` where the corresponding bits of the two numbers differ. For example, if you XOR `13` (which is `1101` in binary) and `9` (which is `1001` in binary), the result will be `0100` (which is `4` in decimal).

2. **Count Set Bits**: After performing the XOR operation, you need to check how many bits are set to `1` in the result. If the result has exactly one bit set, it means the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position.

3. **Return Result**: Based on the count of set bits, return `True` if there is exactly one bit set, and `False` otherwise.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic in Python:

```python
def differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(num1, num2):
    # Perform XOR operation
    xor_result = num1 ^ num2
    # Check if exactly one bit is set in the result
    return xor_result != 0 and (xor_result & (xor_result - 1)) == 0

# Example usage
assert differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(13, 9) == True
```

In this implementation:
- `xor_result != 0` ensures that the two numbers are not the same.
- `(xor_result & (xor_result - 1)) == 0` checks if there is exactly one bit set in `xor_result`. This works because subtracting `1` from a number flips all the bits after the rightmost set bit, and performing an AND operation with the original number will yield `0` if there was only one bit set. 

This function will correctly identify if the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To determine if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **XOR Operation**: Use the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) to compare the two numbers. The XOR operation will yield a number that has bits set to `1` where the corresponding bits of the two numbers differ. For example, if you XOR `13` (which is `1101` in binary) and `9` (which is `1001` in binary), the result will be `0100` (which is `4` in decimal).

2. **Count Set Bits**: After performing the XOR operation, you need to check how many bits are set to `1` in the result. If the result has exactly one bit set, it means the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position.

3. **Return Result**: Based on the count of set bits, return `True` if there is exactly one bit set, and `False` otherwise.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic in Python:

```python
def differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(num1, num2):
    # Perform XOR operation
    xor_result = num1 ^ num2
    # Check if exactly one bit is set in the result
    return xor_result != 0 and (xor_result & (xor_result - 1)) == 0

# Example usage
assert differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(13, 9) == True
```

In this implementation:
- `xor_result != 0` ensures that the two numbers are not the same.
- `(xor_result & (xor_result - 1)) == 0` checks if there is exactly one bit set in `xor_result`. This works because subtracting `1` from a number flips all the bits after the rightmost set bit, and performing an AND operation with the original number will yield `0` if there was only one bit set. 

This function will correctly identify if the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/6 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct approach to solve the task. The XOR operation will indeed give us a number with bits set to 1 where the two numbers differ. Then, checking if the result has exactly one bit set can be done by ensuring that the number is not zero and that it has no other bits set to 1, which is what the expression `(xor_result & (xor_result - 1)) == 0` does.

Plan:
1) Define the function `differ_At_One_Bit_Pos` with two parameters, `num1` and `num2`.
2) Perform the XOR operation on `num1` and `num2` and store the result in `xor_result`.
3) Check if `xor_result` is not zero and if `xor_result` has exactly one bit set by using the expression `(xor_result & (xor_result - 1)) == 0`.
4) Return `True` if both conditions are met, otherwise return `False`.

Code:
```python
def differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(num1: int, num2: int) -> bool:
    # Perform XOR operation
    xor_result = num1 ^ num2
    # Check if exactly one bit is set in the result
    return xor_result != 0 and (xor_result & (xor_result - 1)) == 0
