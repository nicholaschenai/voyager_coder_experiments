INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/256 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a python function that takes in a non-negative number and returns the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number.
assert count_Primes_nums(5) == 2
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/256 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of counting the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `count_Primes_nums` that takes a single argument, which is the non-negative number.

2. **Check for Edge Cases**: If the input number is less than 2, return 0 immediately, since there are no prime numbers less than 2.

3. **Create a Helper Function to Check Primality**: Define a helper function that checks if a number is prime. A prime number is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself. You can check for factors from 2 up to the square root of the number for efficiency.

4. **Iterate Through Numbers**: Use a loop to iterate through all numbers from 2 up to (but not including) the given number. For each number, use the helper function to check if it is prime.

5. **Count Primes**: Maintain a counter that increments each time a prime number is found.

6. **Return the Count**: After the loop, return the count of prime numbers found.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def count_Primes_nums(n):
    if n < 2:
        return 0

    def is_prime(num):
        if num < 2:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
            if num % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

    count = 0
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_prime(i):
            count += 1

    return count
```

This function will correctly count the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number, as demonstrated by the assertion `assert count_Primes_nums(5) == 2`.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
