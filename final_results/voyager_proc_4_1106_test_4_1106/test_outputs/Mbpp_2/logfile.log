"""
Write a function to find the shared elements from the given two lists.
assert set(similar_elements((3, 4, 5, 6),(5, 7, 4, 10))) == set((4, 5))
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/2 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding shared elements between two lists in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function that takes two lists (or tuples) as input parameters.

2. **Convert to Sets**: Inside the function, convert both input lists to sets. This is because sets in Python automatically handle duplicates and provide efficient operations for finding common elements.

3. **Find Intersection**: Use the intersection operation provided by sets to find the common elements between the two sets. This can be done using the `&` operator or the `.intersection()` method.

4. **Return the Result**: Convert the resulting set of shared elements back to a list or leave it as a set, depending on your requirements, and return it.

5. **Assertion for Testing**: Use an assertion to test the function by comparing the output with the expected result.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def similar_elements(list1, list2):
    # Convert lists to sets
    set1 = set(list1)
    set2 = set(list2)
    
    # Find the intersection
    shared_elements = set1 & set2  # or set1.intersection(set2)
    
    # Return the shared elements
    return shared_elements

# Example usage and assertion
assert set(similar_elements((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10))) == set((4, 5))
```

This function will correctly identify and return the shared elements between the two input lists.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/2 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan for implementing the function. The steps outlined are appropriate for finding the shared elements between two lists (or tuples).

Plan:
1) Define the function `similar_elements` that takes two tuples as input parameters.

4) Return the resulting set of shared elements.

    # Find the intersection (shared elements)
