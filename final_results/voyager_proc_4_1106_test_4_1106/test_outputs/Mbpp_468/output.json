    "critique": "The function should not only check if the current element is greater than the previous one but also ensure that the subsequence formed is strictly increasing. To fix the issue, the function should maintain a separate list to track the maximum product of an increasing subsequence ending at each index, considering only those previous elements that are part of an increasing subsequence. The current implementation incorrectly multiplies the current element with the maximum product found so far, which may include non-increasing subsequences."
