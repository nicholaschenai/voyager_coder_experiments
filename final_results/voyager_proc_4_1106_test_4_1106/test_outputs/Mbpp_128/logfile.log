"""
Write a function to find words that are longer than n characters from a given list of words.
assert long_words(3,"python is a programming language")==['python','programming','language']
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/128 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding words longer than a specified number of characters from a given list of words in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `long_words` that takes two parameters: an integer `n` (the minimum length of words to consider) and a string of words.

2. **Split the String into Words**: Use the `split()` method on the string to convert it into a list of individual words.

3. **Filter the Words**: Use a list comprehension or a loop to iterate through the list of words and check the length of each word using the `len()` function. Include only those words whose length is greater than `n`.

4. **Return the Result**: Return the filtered list of words that meet the length requirement.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def long_words(n, sentence):
    # Step 2: Split the sentence into words
    words = sentence.split()
    
    # Step 3: Filter words longer than n characters
    long_words_list = [word for word in words if len(word) > n]
    
    # Step 4: Return the list of long words
    return long_words_list
```

With this function, you can assert the expected output as shown in the example. When you call `long_words(3, "python is a programming language")`, it will return `['python', 'programming', 'language']`, which are the words longer than 3 characters.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

Write a function to find words that are longer than n characters from a given list of words.

"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding words longer than a specified number of characters from a given list of words in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `long_words` that takes two parameters: an integer `n` (the minimum length of words to consider) and a string of words.

2. **Split the String into Words**: Use the `split()` method on the string to convert it into a list of individual words.

3. **Filter the Words**: Use a list comprehension or a loop to iterate through the list of words and check the length of each word using the `len()` function. Include only those words whose length is greater than `n`.

4. **Return the Result**: Return the filtered list of words that meet the length requirement.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def long_words(n, sentence):
    # Step 2: Split the sentence into words
    words = sentence.split()
    
    # Step 3: Filter words longer than n characters
    long_words_list = [word for word in words if len(word) > n]
    
    # Step 4: Return the list of long words
    return long_words_list
```

With this function, you can assert the expected output as shown in the example. When you call `long_words(3, "python is a programming language")`, it will return `['python', 'programming', 'language']`, which are the words longer than 3 characters.
