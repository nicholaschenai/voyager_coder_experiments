INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/223 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of determining whether a given element is the majority element in a sorted array, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand the Majority Element**: A majority element in an array is defined as an element that appears more than `n/2` times, where `n` is the length of the array.

2. **Utilize the Sorted Property**: Since the array is sorted, all occurrences of the majority element (if it exists) will be contiguous. This means that if the element is the majority, it will occupy a block of positions in the array.

3. **Count Occurrences**: You can find the first and last occurrence of the element in the array. The difference between these two indices will help you determine how many times the element appears.

4. **Check Majority Condition**: After counting the occurrences, check if this count is greater than `n/2`. If it is, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.

5. **Implementation**: You can implement this using a simple loop or by using the `bisect` module to find the indices efficiently.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def is_majority(arr, n, element):
    # Find the first occurrence of the element
    first_index = arr.index(element)
    # Find the last occurrence of the element
    last_index = len(arr) - 1 - arr[::-1].index(element)
    
    # Calculate the count of the element
    count = last_index - first_index + 1
    
    # Check if count is greater than n/2
    return count > n / 2
```

This function first finds the indices of the first and last occurrences of the element, calculates the count, and then checks if it exceeds `n/2`.

Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/223 [generation text] Explain: The provided context gives a rough plan to determine if an element is the majority element in a sorted array. However, the plan does not consider the case where the element is not present in the array, which would cause the `arr.index(element)` to raise a `ValueError`. To handle this, we need to check if the element is in the array before trying to find its index.

Plan:
1) Check if the element is present in the array. If it is not, return `False` immediately.
2) Find the first occurrence of the element using binary search since the array is sorted. This is more efficient than using `arr.index(element)`.
3) Find the last occurrence of the element. This can be done by modifying the binary search to find the last occurrence.
4) Calculate the count of the element by subtracting the index of the first occurrence from the index of the last occurrence and adding 1.
5) Check if the count is greater than `n/2`. If it is, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.

Code:
```python
def is_majority(arr, n, element):
    # Helper function to find the first occurrence of the element using binary search
    def find_first(arr, element):
        low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if arr[mid] < element:
                low = mid + 1
            elif arr[mid] > element or (mid > 0 and arr[mid-1] == element):
                high = mid - 1
            else:
                return mid
        return -1

    # Helper function to find the last occurrence of the element using binary search
    def find_last(arr, element):
        low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if arr[mid] > element:
                high = mid - 1
            elif arr[mid] < element or (mid < len(arr) - 1 and arr[mid+1] == element):
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                return mid
        return -1

    # Check if the element is present in the array
    if element not in arr:
        return False

    # Find the first and last occurrence of the element
    first_index = find_first(arr, element)
    last_index = find_last(arr, element)

    # Calculate the count of the element
    count = last_index - first_index + 1

    # Check if count is greater than n/2
    return count > n / 2

This code defines two helper functions to find the first and last occurrences of the element using binary search, which is more efficient for sorted arrays than linear search. Then it calculates the count of the element and checks if it is the majority element.
