INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/230 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function that takes in a string and character, replaces blank spaces in the string with the character, and returns the string.
assert replace_blank("hello people",'@')==("hello@people")
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/230 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of replacing blank spaces in a string with a specified character in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes two parameters: the input string and the character to replace the spaces.

2. **Use String Replacement**: Utilize the string method `replace()` which allows you to specify a substring to be replaced with another substring. In this case, you will replace the blank space (' ') with the specified character.

3. **Return the Result**: After performing the replacement, return the modified string.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def replace_blank(input_string, replacement_char):
    # Replace spaces with the specified character
    modified_string = input_string.replace(' ', replacement_char)
    # Return the modified string
    return modified_string
```

4. **Testing the Function**: You can test the function using an assertion to ensure it behaves as expected, as shown in the provided example.

By following these steps, you can effectively create a function that meets the requirements of the task.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/230 [generation text] Plan:
1) Define the function `replace_blank` with two parameters: `input_string` and `replacement_char`.
2) Use the `replace` method of the string to replace all occurrences of a space (' ') with `replacement_char`.
3) Return the modified string.

Code:
```python
def replace_blank(input_string, replacement_char):
    return input_string.replace(' ', replacement_char)

The provided plan is correct and can be directly translated into code. The `replace` method is a built-in string method in Python that replaces occurrences of a specified substring with another substring, which is exactly what is needed for this task.
