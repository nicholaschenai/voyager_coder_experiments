"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/245 [generation text] Answer: To solve the problem of finding the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence in an array, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understanding Bitonic Subsequences**: A bitonic subsequence is one that first increases and then decreases. For example, in the array `[1, 15, 51, 45, 33, 100, 12, 18, 9]`, a bitonic subsequence could be `[1, 15, 51, 100, 12]`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: You can use dynamic programming to find the maximum sum of such subsequences. The idea is to break the problem into two parts:
   - Find the maximum sum of increasing subsequences (from the start to each index).
   - Find the maximum sum of decreasing subsequences (from each index to the end).

3. **Calculate Maximum Sum of Increasing Subsequences**:
   - Create an array `inc_sum` where `inc_sum[i]` will store the maximum sum of increasing subsequences that end at index `i`.
   - Initialize each `inc_sum[i]` with the value of the array at that index.
   - For each element, check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence. If `arr[j] < arr[i]`, update `inc_sum[i]` as `inc_sum[i] = max(inc_sum[i], inc_sum[j] + arr[i])`.

4. **Calculate Maximum Sum of Decreasing Subsequences**:
   - Similarly, create an array `dec_sum` where `dec_sum[i]` will store the maximum sum of decreasing subsequences that start at index `i`.
   - Initialize each `dec_sum[i]` with the value of the array at that index.
   - For each element, check all subsequent elements to see if they can form a decreasing subsequence. If `arr[j] < arr[i]`, update `dec_sum[i]` as `dec_sum[i] = max(dec_sum[i], dec_sum[j] + arr[i])`.

5. **Combine Results**: The maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence can be found by iterating through each index and calculating the total sum of the increasing and decreasing subsequences at that index, subtracting the value at that index (since it is counted twice). The formula would be:
   - `max_sum = max(inc_sum[i] + dec_sum[i] - arr[i])` for all valid `i`.

6. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the maximum sum found.

By following these steps, you can implement the function to find the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence in Python.

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To solve the problem of finding the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence in an array, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understanding Bitonic Subsequences**: A bitonic subsequence is one that first increases and then decreases. For example, in the array `[1, 15, 51, 45, 33, 100, 12, 18, 9]`, a bitonic subsequence could be `[1, 15, 51, 100, 12]`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: You can use dynamic programming to find the maximum sum of such subsequences. The idea is to break the problem into two parts:
   - Find the maximum sum of increasing subsequences (from the start to each index).
   - Find the maximum sum of decreasing subsequences (from each index to the end).

3. **Calculate Maximum Sum of Increasing Subsequences**:
   - Create an array `inc_sum` where `inc_sum[i]` will store the maximum sum of increasing subsequences that end at index `i`.
   - Initialize each `inc_sum[i]` with the value of the array at that index.
   - For each element, check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence. If `arr[j] < arr[i]`, update `inc_sum[i]` as `inc_sum[i] = max(inc_sum[i], inc_sum[j] + arr[i])`.

4. **Calculate Maximum Sum of Decreasing Subsequences**:
   - Similarly, create an array `dec_sum` where `dec_sum[i]` will store the maximum sum of decreasing subsequences that start at index `i`.
   - Initialize each `dec_sum[i]` with the value of the array at that index.
   - For each element, check all subsequent elements to see if they can form a decreasing subsequence. If `arr[j] < arr[i]`, update `dec_sum[i]` as `dec_sum[i] = max(dec_sum[i], dec_sum[j] + arr[i])`.

5. **Combine Results**: The maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence can be found by iterating through each index and calculating the total sum of the increasing and decreasing subsequences at that index, subtracting the value at that index (since it is counted twice). The formula would be:
   - `max_sum = max(inc_sum[i] + dec_sum[i] - arr[i])` for all valid `i`.

6. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the maximum sum found.

By following these steps, you can implement the function to find the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence in Python.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/245 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a detailed plan for implementing the function to find the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence. The plan involves using dynamic programming to calculate the maximum sum of increasing subsequences up to each index and the maximum sum of decreasing subsequences from each index to the end. Then, it combines these results to find the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence.

Plan:
1) Initialize two lists, `inc_sum` and `dec_sum`, of the same length as the input array, to store the maximum sum of increasing and decreasing subsequences, respectively.
2) Populate `inc_sum` by iterating over the array from left to right, ensuring that for each element, we consider the maximum sum of all increasing subsequences that end at that element.
3) Populate `dec_sum` by iterating over the array from right to left, ensuring that for each element, we consider the maximum sum of all decreasing subsequences that start at that element.
4) Iterate over all indices to find the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence by combining the sums from `inc_sum` and `dec_sum` and subtracting the current element's value (since it's included in both sums).
5) Return the maximum sum found.

Code:
```python
def max_sum(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Initialize the inc_sum and dec_sum arrays
    inc_sum = arr.copy()
    dec_sum = arr.copy()
    
    # Calculate the maximum sum of increasing subsequences
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            if arr[j] < arr[i]:
                inc_sum[i] = max(inc_sum[i], inc_sum[j] + arr[i])
    
    # Calculate the maximum sum of decreasing subsequences
    for i in reversed(range(n)):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if arr[j] < arr[i]:
                dec_sum[i] = max(dec_sum[i], dec_sum[j] + arr[i])
    
    # Find the maximum sum of bitonic subsequences
    max_bitonic_sum = 0
    for i in range(n):
        max_bitonic_sum = max(max_bitonic_sum, inc_sum[i] + dec_sum[i] - arr[i])
    
    return max_bitonic_sum
```

Now, let's test the function with the provided assertion:
