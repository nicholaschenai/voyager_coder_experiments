"""
Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
assert largest_subset([ 1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18 ]) == 4
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/620 [generation text] Answer: To solve the problem of finding the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair in the subset is divisible, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understanding Divisibility**: For a pair of numbers (a, b) to be divisible, either a % b == 0 or b % a == 0 must hold true. This means that one number must be a multiple of the other.

2. **Sorting the List**: Start by sorting the list of numbers. This helps in efficiently checking divisibility since if a number is divisible by another, it will appear later in the sorted list.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: Use a dynamic programming (DP) approach to keep track of the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with each number in the sorted list. Create a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with the number at index `i`.

4. **Filling the DP Array**: For each number in the sorted list, check all previous numbers to see if they can form a divisible pair. If `numbers[j]` is divisible by `numbers[i]`, then you can potentially extend the subset ending at `j` to include `i`. Update `dp[i]` accordingly.

5. **Finding the Maximum**: The result will be the maximum value in the DP array, which represents the size of the largest subset found.

Here is a high-level outline of the function:

```python
def largest_subset(numbers):
    numbers.sort()  # Step 2: Sort the list
    n = len(numbers)
    dp = [1] * n  # Step 3: Initialize DP array

    # Step 4: Fill the DP array
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            if numbers[i] % numbers[j] == 0:  # Check divisibility
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)

    # Step 5: Return the maximum size found
    return max(dp)
```

This function will correctly compute the size of the largest subset where every pair is divisible, as demonstrated by the provided assertion.

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To solve the problem of finding the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair in the subset is divisible, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understanding Divisibility**: For a pair of numbers (a, b) to be divisible, either a % b == 0 or b % a == 0 must hold true. This means that one number must be a multiple of the other.

2. **Sorting the List**: Start by sorting the list of numbers. This helps in efficiently checking divisibility since if a number is divisible by another, it will appear later in the sorted list.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: Use a dynamic programming (DP) approach to keep track of the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with each number in the sorted list. Create a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with the number at index `i`.

4. **Filling the DP Array**: For each number in the sorted list, check all previous numbers to see if they can form a divisible pair. If `numbers[j]` is divisible by `numbers[i]`, then you can potentially extend the subset ending at `j` to include `i`. Update `dp[i]` accordingly.

5. **Finding the Maximum**: The result will be the maximum value in the DP array, which represents the size of the largest subset found.

Here is a high-level outline of the function:

```python
def largest_subset(numbers):
    numbers.sort()  # Step 2: Sort the list
    n = len(numbers)
    dp = [1] * n  # Step 3: Initialize DP array

    # Step 4: Fill the DP array
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            if numbers[i] % numbers[j] == 0:  # Check divisibility
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)

    # Step 5: Return the maximum size found
    return max(dp)
```

This function will correctly compute the size of the largest subset where every pair is divisible, as demonstrated by the provided assertion.

The steps outlined are appropriate for the problem at hand, and the provided code snippet is a good starting point. The task is to find the largest subset of numbers such that every pair of numbers within the subset is divisible by each other. The dynamic programming approach suggested is suitable for this problem.
