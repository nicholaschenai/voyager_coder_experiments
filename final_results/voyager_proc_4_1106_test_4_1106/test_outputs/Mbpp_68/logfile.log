"""
Write a python function to check whether the given array is monotonic or not.
assert is_Monotonic([6, 5, 4, 4]) == True
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/68 [generation text] Answer: To determine if an array is monotonic, you need to check if it is either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing. A monotonic array is one that is either always increasing or always decreasing, or remains constant.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual approach to accomplish this task in Python:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `is_Monotonic` that takes an array (list) as an argument.

2. **Check for Edge Cases**: If the array has one or no elements, it is trivially monotonic, so you can return `True`.

3. **Initialize Flags**: Use two boolean flags, `increasing` and `decreasing`, and set them to `True`.

4. **Iterate Through the Array**: Loop through the array and compare each element with the next one:
   - If you find an element that is greater than the next one, set the `increasing` flag to `False`.
   - If you find an element that is less than the next one, set the `decreasing` flag to `False`.

5. **Return the Result**: After the loop, if either `increasing` or `decreasing` is still `True`, return `True`, indicating the array is monotonic. Otherwise, return `False`.

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of the above logic:

```python
def is_Monotonic(array):
    if len(array) <= 1:
        return True
    
    increasing = True
    decreasing = True
    
    for i in range(len(array) - 1):
        if array[i] < array[i + 1]:
            decreasing = False
        elif array[i] > array[i + 1]:
            increasing = False
            
    return increasing or decreasing
```

This function will correctly check if the given array is monotonic based on the conditions described.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

        elif array[i] > array[i + 1]:
            increasing = False
            
    return increasing or decreasing
```

This function will correctly check if the given array is monotonic based on the conditions described.
