INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/64 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of sorting a list of tuples based on the second value of each tuple in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a list of tuples as an argument.

2. **Use the `sorted()` Function**: Utilize Python's built-in `sorted()` function, which allows you to sort iterables. This function can take a key parameter that specifies a function to be called on each element prior to making comparisons.

3. **Define a Key Function**: For the key parameter, you can use a lambda function that extracts the second element of each tuple (i.e., `x[1]` where `x` is a tuple). This will ensure that the sorting is based on the second value of each tuple.

4. **Return the Sorted List**: Finally, return the sorted list from your function.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def subject_marks(marks):
    return sorted(marks, key=lambda x: x[1])
```

In this function:
- `marks` is the input list of tuples.
- `sorted(marks, key=lambda x: x[1])` sorts the tuples based on the second element of each tuple.

By following these steps, you can achieve the desired sorting of the list of tuples.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
