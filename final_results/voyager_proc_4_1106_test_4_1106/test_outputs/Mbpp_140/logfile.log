INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/140 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of flattening a list of lists into a single set of numbers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function named `extract_singly` that takes a list of tuples (or lists) as an argument.

2. **Initialize an Empty Set**: Inside the function, create an empty set to store unique numbers. Using a set is important because it automatically handles duplicates for you.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to iterate through each tuple (or list) in the input list.

4. **Extract Elements**: For each tuple, iterate through its elements and add each element to the set. This can be done using a nested loop or a set comprehension.

5. **Return the Set**: After processing all tuples, return the set containing all unique numbers.

Here is a conceptual example of how the function might look:

```python
def extract_singly(list_of_tuples):
    unique_numbers = set()  # Step 2: Initialize an empty set
    for tup in list_of_tuples:  # Step 3: Iterate through the list
        for number in tup:  # Step 4: Extract elements
            unique_numbers.add(number)  # Add each number to the set
    return unique_numbers  # Step 5: Return the set
```

This function can then be tested with the provided assertion to ensure it works correctly.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
