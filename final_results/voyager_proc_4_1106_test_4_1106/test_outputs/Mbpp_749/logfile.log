INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/749 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of sorting a list of strings that represent numbers numerically in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function named `sort_numeric_strings` that takes a list of strings as an argument.

2. **Convert Strings to Integers**: Inside the function, convert each string in the list to an integer. This is crucial because you want to sort the numbers based on their numeric value rather than their lexicographic (string) order.

3. **Sort the List**: Use Python's built-in sorting functionality to sort the list of integers. The `sorted()` function or the `.sort()` method can be used for this purpose.

4. **Return the Sorted List**: Finally, return the sorted list of integers.

Here is a conceptual outline of the code:

```python
def sort_numeric_strings(string_list):
    # Convert the list of strings to a list of integers
    int_list = [int(num) for num in string_list]
    
    # Sort the list of integers
    sorted_list = sorted(int_list)
    
    # Return the sorted list
    return sorted_list
```

5. **Testing the Function**: You can use the provided assertion to test if your function works correctly. The assertion checks if the output of your function matches the expected sorted list of integers.

By following these steps, you can effectively sort a list of numeric strings numerically in Python.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
