INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/633 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a python function to find the sum of xor of all pairs of numbers in the given list.
assert pair_xor_Sum([5,9,7,6],4) == 47
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/633 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the sum of the XOR of all pairs of numbers in a given list, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand XOR Operation**: The XOR (exclusive OR) operation between two bits results in 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same. For example, `5 XOR 9` would yield a certain result based on their binary representations.

2. **Generate Pairs**: You need to consider all unique pairs of numbers from the list. This can be done using nested loops or by using combinations from the `itertools` module.

3. **Calculate XOR for Each Pair**: For each pair of numbers, compute the XOR using the `^` operator in Python.

4. **Sum the Results**: Maintain a running total of the XOR results for all pairs.

5. **Return the Total**: Finally, return the accumulated sum.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def pair_xor_Sum(arr, n):
    total_xor_sum = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            total_xor_sum += arr[i] ^ arr[j]
    return total_xor_sum
```

In this function:
- `arr` is the list of numbers.
- `n` is the length of the list.
- The outer loop iterates through each element, and the inner loop iterates through the subsequent elements to form pairs.
- The XOR of each pair is calculated and added to `total_xor_sum`.

This function should satisfy the assertion provided in the question.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/633 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a rough plan that seems correct for the task. We need to calculate the XOR for each unique pair in the list and sum these values.

Plan:
1) Define the function `pair_xor_Sum` that takes a list `arr` and an integer `n` as arguments.
2) Initialize a variable `total_xor_sum` to 0 to keep track of the sum of XOR values.
3) Use a nested loop to iterate over all unique pairs in the list. The outer loop will run from 0 to `n-1` and the inner loop will run from `i+1` to `n`.
4) For each pair, calculate the XOR using the `^` operator and add the result to `total_xor_sum`.
5) After all pairs have been processed, return `total_xor_sum`.

Code:
```python
def pair_xor_Sum(arr, n):
    total_xor_sum = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            total_xor_sum += arr[i] ^ arr[j]
    return total_xor_sum
