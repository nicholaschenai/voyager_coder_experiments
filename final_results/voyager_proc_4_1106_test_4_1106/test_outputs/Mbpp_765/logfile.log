INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/765 [generation text] Answer: To find the nth polite number in Python, you need to understand what polite numbers are. Polite numbers are positive integers that can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. Notably, all positive integers except powers of two are polite numbers.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual approach to accomplish the task:

1. **Understand Polite Numbers**: Since polite numbers are all positive integers except for powers of two, you can generate polite numbers by skipping powers of two.

2. **Generate Polite Numbers**: You can create a function that iterates through positive integers, checking if each number is a power of two. If it is not, you add it to a list of polite numbers.

3. **Check for Powers of Two**: To check if a number is a power of two, you can use the property that a number `n` is a power of two if `n & (n - 1) == 0` and `n > 0`.

4. **Return the nth Polite Number**: Once you have a list of polite numbers, you can simply return the nth element from this list.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def is_power_of_two(n):
    return n > 0 and (n & (n - 1)) == 0

def nth_polite_number(n):
    polite_numbers = []
    current_number = 1
    
    while len(polite_numbers) < n:
        if not is_power_of_two(current_number):
            polite_numbers.append(current_number)
        current_number += 1
    
    return polite_numbers[n - 1]  # n is 1-based index

# Example usage
assert nth_polite_number(7) == 11
```

In this code:
- `is_power_of_two` checks if a number is a power of two.
- `nth_polite_number` generates polite numbers until it reaches the nth one and returns it.

This approach efficiently finds the nth polite number by leveraging the properties of numbers.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/765 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a good starting point for the task. It explains what polite numbers are and gives a rough plan to find the nth polite number. The plan involves creating a function to check if a number is a power of two and then iterating through numbers to find polite numbers until the nth one is reached.

Plan:
1) Write a function `is_power_of_two` that checks if a number is a power of two using the bitwise AND operation as described in the context.
2) Write the main function `is_polite` that will find the nth polite number by iterating through positive integers and skipping powers of two.
3) In the `is_polite` function, maintain a counter for the number of polite numbers found and increment it each time a polite number is identified.
4) Once the counter reaches `n`, return the current number as the nth polite number.
5) Ensure that the function name matches the one specified in the assert statement (`is_polite` instead of `nth_polite_number`).

Code:
```python
def is_power_of_two(n):
    # Check if a number is a power of two
    return n > 0 and (n & (n - 1)) == 0

def is_polite(n):
    # Find the nth polite number
