INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/786 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
assert right_insertion([1,2,4,5],6)==4
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/786 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of locating the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: You need to find the index in a sorted list where a given value can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order. For example, if the list is `[1, 2, 4, 5]` and the value is `6`, the correct insertion point is `4`, which is the index where `6` would be placed after the last element.

2. **Iterate Through the List**: You can iterate through the list and compare each element with the specified value. Keep track of the index where the value is greater than the current element.

3. **Return the Index**: Once you find an element that is greater than the specified value, return the current index as the insertion point. If the value is greater than all elements in the list, return the length of the list.

4. **Use Binary Search for Efficiency**: Since the list is sorted, you can optimize the search using a binary search algorithm, which reduces the time complexity from O(n) to O(log n).

5. **Implement the Function**: Write a function that implements the above logic.

Here is a simple implementation of the function:

```python
def right_insertion(sorted_list, value):
    for index, current in enumerate(sorted_list):
        if current > value:
            return index
    return len(sorted_list)

# Example usage
assert right_insertion([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4
```

This function iterates through the sorted list and returns the index where the value can be inserted. If the value is greater than all elements, it returns the length of the list, indicating that the value should be appended at the end.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of locating the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: You need to find the index in a sorted list where a given value can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order. For example, if the list is `[1, 2, 4, 5]` and the value is `6`, the correct insertion point is `4`, which is the index where `6` would be placed after the last element.

2. **Iterate Through the List**: You can iterate through the list and compare each element with the specified value. Keep track of the index where the value is greater than the current element.

3. **Return the Index**: Once you find an element that is greater than the specified value, return the current index as the insertion point. If the value is greater than all elements in the list, return the length of the list.

4. **Use Binary Search for Efficiency**: Since the list is sorted, you can optimize the search using a binary search algorithm, which reduces the time complexity from O(n) to O(log n).

5. **Implement the Function**: Write a function that implements the above logic.

Here is a simple implementation of the function:

```python
def right_insertion(sorted_list, value):
    for index, current in enumerate(sorted_list):
        if current > value:
            return index
    return len(sorted_list)

# Example usage
assert right_insertion([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4
```

This function iterates through the sorted list and returns the index where the value can be inserted. If the value is greater than all elements, it returns the length of the list, indicating that the value should be appended at the end.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/786 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a rough plan that suggests using a linear search to find the right insertion point. However, it also mentions that using binary search would be more efficient for a sorted list. The task requires writing a function that finds the right insertion point for a value in a sorted list, and the function must pass the given assert statement.

Plan:
1) Define a function named `right_insertion` that takes two arguments: `sorted_list` and `value`.
2) Implement a binary search algorithm within the function to find the right insertion point for the `value`.
3) If the `value` is greater than all elements in the list, return the length of the list.
4) If the `value` should be inserted before any element, return the index of that element.
5) Ensure that the function passes the provided assert statement.

Code:
```python
def right_insertion(sorted_list, value):
    left, right = 0, len(sorted_list)
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if sorted_list[mid] < value:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
