"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/97 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the frequency of each element in a flattened list of lists in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Flatten the List of Lists**: You need to combine all the inner lists into a single list. This can be done using a loop or a list comprehension.

2. **Count Frequencies**: Once you have a single flattened list, you can count the occurrences of each element. This can be efficiently done using a dictionary where the keys are the elements and the values are their respective counts.

3. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the dictionary containing the frequency of each element.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual outline of the function:

- Define a function named `frequency_lists` that takes a list of lists as an argument.
- Initialize an empty dictionary to store the frequency counts.
- Iterate through each sublist and then through each element in the sublist.
- For each element, check if it is already a key in the dictionary. If it is, increment its count; if not, add it to the dictionary with a count of 1.
- After processing all elements, return the dictionary.

This approach ensures that you efficiently count the frequency of each element in the flattened list. 

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic:

```python
def frequency_lists(lists):
    frequency = {}
    for sublist in lists:
        for item in sublist:
            if item in frequency:
                frequency[item] += 1
            else:
                frequency[item] = 1
    return frequency
```

You can then use the `assert` statement to verify that the function works as expected with the provided test case.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the frequency of each element in a flattened list of lists in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Flatten the List of Lists**: You need to combine all the inner lists into a single list. This can be done using a loop or a list comprehension.

2. **Count Frequencies**: Once you have a single flattened list, you can count the occurrences of each element. This can be efficiently done using a dictionary where the keys are the elements and the values are their respective counts.

3. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the dictionary containing the frequency of each element.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual outline of the function:

- Define a function named `frequency_lists` that takes a list of lists as an argument.
- Initialize an empty dictionary to store the frequency counts.
- Iterate through each sublist and then through each element in the sublist.
- For each element, check if it is already a key in the dictionary. If it is, increment its count; if not, add it to the dictionary with a count of 1.
- After processing all elements, return the dictionary.

This approach ensures that you efficiently count the frequency of each element in the flattened list. 

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic:

```python
def frequency_lists(lists):
    frequency = {}
    for sublist in lists:
        for item in sublist:
            if item in frequency:
                frequency[item] += 1
            else:
                frequency[item] = 1
    return frequency
```

You can then use the `assert` statement to verify that the function works as expected with the provided test case.
