"""
Write a function to find the nth nonagonal number.
assert is_nonagonal(10) == 325
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/641 [generation text] Answer: To find the nth nonagonal number in Python, you first need to understand the formula for nonagonal numbers. Nonagonal numbers are a type of figurate number that can be represented in a nonagon (nine-sided polygon). The formula for the nth nonagonal number is given by:

\[ P(n) = \frac{n(7n - 5)}{2} \]

Where \( P(n) \) is the nth nonagonal number.

To accomplish the task, you can follow these steps:

1. **Define a function**: Create a function named `nonagonal_number` that takes an integer \( n \) as an argument.

2. **Implement the formula**: Inside the function, use the formula to calculate the nth nonagonal number.

3. **Return the result**: The function should return the calculated nonagonal number.

4. **Create an assertion function**: Define another function `is_nonagonal` that checks if a given number is a nonagonal number by comparing it to the output of the `nonagonal_number` function.

Here is a conceptual implementation:

```python
def nonagonal_number(n):
    return n * (7 * n - 5) // 2  # Use integer division

def is_nonagonal(num):
    # Check if there exists an n such that nonagonal_number(n) == num
    n = 1
    while True:
        nonagonal = nonagonal_number(n)
        if nonagonal == num:
            return True
        elif nonagonal > num:
            return False
        n += 1

# Example usage
assert is_nonagonal(nonagonal_number(10)) == True
```

In this implementation:
- The `nonagonal_number` function computes the nth nonagonal number.
- The `is_nonagonal` function checks if a given number is a nonagonal number by iterating through possible values of \( n \) until it finds a match or exceeds the number.

This approach allows you to find and verify nonagonal numbers effectively.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To find the nth nonagonal number in Python, you first need to understand the formula for nonagonal numbers. Nonagonal numbers are a type of figurate number that can be represented in a nonagon (nine-sided polygon). The formula for the nth nonagonal number is given by:

\[ P(n) = \frac{n(7n - 5)}{2} \]

Where \( P(n) \) is the nth nonagonal number.

To accomplish the task, you can follow these steps:

1. **Define a function**: Create a function named `nonagonal_number` that takes an integer \( n \) as an argument.

2. **Implement the formula**: Inside the function, use the formula to calculate the nth nonagonal number.

3. **Return the result**: The function should return the calculated nonagonal number.

4. **Create an assertion function**: Define another function `is_nonagonal` that checks if a given number is a nonagonal number by comparing it to the output of the `nonagonal_number` function.

Here is a conceptual implementation:

```python
def nonagonal_number(n):
    return n * (7 * n - 5) // 2  # Use integer division

def is_nonagonal(num):
    # Check if there exists an n such that nonagonal_number(n) == num
    n = 1
    while True:
        nonagonal = nonagonal_number(n)
        if nonagonal == num:
            return True
        elif nonagonal > num:
            return False
        n += 1

# Example usage
assert is_nonagonal(nonagonal_number(10)) == True
```

In this implementation:
- The `nonagonal_number` function computes the nth nonagonal number.
- The `is_nonagonal` function checks if a given number is a nonagonal number by iterating through possible values of \( n \) until it finds a match or exceeds the number.

This approach allows you to find and verify nonagonal numbers effectively.
