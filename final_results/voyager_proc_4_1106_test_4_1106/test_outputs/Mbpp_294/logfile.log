"""
Write a function to find the maximum value in a given heterogeneous list.
assert max_val(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version'])==5
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/294 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the maximum value in a heterogeneous list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function that takes a list as an argument.

2. **Initialize a Variable**: Start by initializing a variable to hold the maximum value found. You can set it to a very low value or the first numeric element in the list.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to go through each element in the list.

4. **Check the Type**: For each element, check if it is a number (either an integer or a float). You can use the `isinstance()` function for this purpose.

5. **Update Maximum Value**: If the element is a number and greater than the current maximum value, update the maximum value variable.

6. **Return the Result**: After iterating through the list, return the maximum value found.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def max_val(heterogeneous_list):
    max_value = float('-inf')  # Start with the lowest possible value
    for item in heterogeneous_list:
        if isinstance(item, (int, float)):  # Check if the item is a number
            if item > max_value:  # Compare with current max
                max_value = item  # Update max_value
    return max_value  # Return the maximum value found
```

This function will correctly find the maximum numeric value in a list that contains mixed types, as demonstrated by the assertion provided in the question.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the maximum value in a heterogeneous list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function that takes a list as an argument.

2. **Initialize a Variable**: Start by initializing a variable to hold the maximum value found. You can set it to a very low value or the first numeric element in the list.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to go through each element in the list.

4. **Check the Type**: For each element, check if it is a number (either an integer or a float). You can use the `isinstance()` function for this purpose.

5. **Update Maximum Value**: If the element is a number and greater than the current maximum value, update the maximum value variable.

6. **Return the Result**: After iterating through the list, return the maximum value found.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def max_val(heterogeneous_list):
    max_value = float('-inf')  # Start with the lowest possible value
    for item in heterogeneous_list:
        if isinstance(item, (int, float)):  # Check if the item is a number
            if item > max_value:  # Compare with current max
                max_value = item  # Update max_value
    return max_value  # Return the maximum value found
```

This function will correctly find the maximum numeric value in a list that contains mixed types, as demonstrated by the assertion provided in the question.
