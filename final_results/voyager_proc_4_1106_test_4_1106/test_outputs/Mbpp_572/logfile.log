INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/572 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a python function to remove duplicate numbers from a given number of lists.
assert two_unique_nums([1,2,3,2,3,4,5]) == [1, 4, 5]
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/572 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of removing duplicate numbers from a given list while retaining only the unique numbers, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Initialize a Counter**: Use a dictionary or a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each number in the list.

2. **Iterate Through the List**: Loop through the list and update the counter for each number.

3. **Filter Unique Numbers**: After counting, create a new list that includes only those numbers that have a count of 1, indicating they are unique.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the list of unique numbers.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def two_unique_nums(numbers):
    from collections import Counter
    
    # Step 1: Count occurrences of each number
    count = Counter(numbers)
    
    # Step 2: Filter and collect unique numbers
    unique_numbers = [num for num, cnt in count.items() if cnt == 1]
    
    return unique_numbers
```

This function will take a list of numbers, count how many times each number appears, and return a new list containing only those numbers that appear exactly once. The assertion provided in the question can be used to test the function.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
