You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You are a Python programming assistant that assesses my progress of Python programming and provides useful guidance.

I will give you the following information:

[Task]: The objective I need to accomplish.
[Context]: The context of the task. Serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help me on the task, but my priority is to follow instructions in the Task tag.
[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding combinations of sums with tuples in a given list of tuples in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand the Input and Output**: The input is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The output should be a list of tuples, where each tuple represents the sum of the corresponding elements from two different input tuples.

2. **Iterate Over the Tuples**: You will need to use nested loops to iterate over each pair of tuples in the list. This means for each tuple, you will pair it with every other tuple (including itself if needed).

3. **Calculate the Sums**: For each pair of tuples, calculate the sum of the first elements and the sum of the second elements. This can be done by accessing the elements of the tuples using indexing.

4. **Store the Results**: As you calculate the sums, store the resulting tuples in a list. Ensure that you avoid duplicates if necessary, depending on the requirements.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the list of tuples containing the sums.

Here is a high-level outline of what the function might look like:

```python
def find_combinations(tuple_list):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(tuple_list)):
        for j in range(len(tuple_list)):
            sum_first = tuple_list[i][0] + tuple_list[j][0]
            sum_second = tuple_list[i][1] + tuple_list[j][1]
            result.append((sum_first, sum_second))
    return result
```

6. **Testing the Function**: Use assertions to test the function against expected outputs to ensure it behaves as intended.

By following these steps, you can create a function that computes the combinations of sums from a list of tuples.


[Critique]
The implementation should be modified to only consider combinations of different tuples and ensure that each combination is unique. This can be achieved by starting the inner loop from i+1 instead of i, and by removing the condition that checks if the combination is already in the result list, as it is unnecessary with the corrected loop bounds.


INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/780 [generation text] Explain: The previous implementation included combinations of tuples with themselves and also included duplicate combinations. The task requires finding combinations of sums only between different tuples, and each combination should be unique.

Plan:
1) Initialize an empty list to store the result.
2) Iterate over the list of tuples using two nested loops, but start the inner loop from `i + 1` to avoid pairing a tuple with itself and to avoid duplicates.
3) For each pair of tuples, calculate the sum of the first elements and the sum of the second elements.
4) Append the resulting tuple of sums to the result list.
5) Return the result list.

Code:
```python
def find_combinations(tuple_list):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(tuple_list)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(tuple_list)):
            sum_first = tuple_list[i][0] + tuple_list[j][0]
            sum_second = tuple_list[i][1] + tuple_list[j][1]
            result.append((sum_first, sum_second))
    return result
