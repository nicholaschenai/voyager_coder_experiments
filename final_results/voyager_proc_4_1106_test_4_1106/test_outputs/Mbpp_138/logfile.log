INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/138 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a python function to check whether the given number can be represented as sum of non-zero powers of 2 or not.
assert is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(10) == True
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/138 [generation text] Answer: To determine if a given number can be represented as a sum of non-zero powers of 2, you can utilize the properties of binary representation. Each non-zero power of 2 corresponds to a bit that is set to 1 in the binary representation of a number.

Here's a conceptual breakdown of how to accomplish this:

1. **Binary Representation**: Every integer can be expressed in binary form, where each bit represents a power of 2. For example, the number 10 in binary is `1010`, which corresponds to \(2^3 + 2^1\) (i.e., 8 + 2).

2. **Check Non-Zero Powers**: To check if a number can be represented as a sum of non-zero powers of 2, you can simply check if the number is greater than zero. If the number is positive, it can be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of 2.

3. **Implementation**: You can implement a function that checks if the number is greater than zero and then returns `True`. If the number is zero or negative, it should return `False`.

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of the function:

```python
def is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(n):
    return n > 0
```

In this function, if you call `is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(10)`, it will return `True`, confirming that 10 can be represented as a sum of non-zero powers of 2. 

This approach is efficient and leverages the properties of binary numbers to achieve the desired result.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To determine if a given number can be represented as a sum of non-zero powers of 2, you can utilize the properties of binary representation. Each non-zero power of 2 corresponds to a bit that is set to 1 in the binary representation of a number.

Here's a conceptual breakdown of how to accomplish this:

2. **Check Non-Zero Powers**: To check if a number can be represented as a sum of non-zero powers of 2, you can simply check if the number is greater than zero. If the number is positive, it can be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of 2.

3. **Implementation**: You can implement a function that checks if the number is greater than zero and then returns `True`. If the number is zero or negative, it should return `False`.

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of the function:

```python

    return n > 0
```

In this function, if you call `is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(10)`, it will return `True`, confirming that 10 can be represented as a sum of non-zero powers of 2. 

This approach is efficient and leverages the properties of binary numbers to achieve the desired result.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/138 [generation text] Explain: The context provided is incorrect. The assertion that any positive number can be represented as a sum of non-zero powers of 2 is true, but the method described is overly simplistic and does not actually check the binary representation of the number. Instead, we need to verify that the number does not contain any bits set that would represent a power of 2 that is not allowed (i.e., zero powers of 2). In binary terms, this means that the number should not have any consecutive bits set to 1, as this would imply a sum of a power of 2 with itself, which is not allowed.

Plan:
1) Check if the number is positive. If it's not, return False.
2) Convert the number to its binary representation.
3) Check if there are any consecutive '1's in the binary representation. If there are, return False, because this would mean that the number is a sum of a power of 2 with itself, which is not allowed.
4) If there are no consecutive '1's, return True, as the number can be represented as a sum of non-zero powers of 2.

Code:
```python
def is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(n: int) -> bool:
    # Check if the number is positive
    if n <= 0:
        return False
    
    # Convert the number to binary and remove the '0b' prefix
