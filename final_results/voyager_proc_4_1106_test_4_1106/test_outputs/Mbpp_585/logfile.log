Write a function to find the n most expensive items in a given dataset.

"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/585 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the n most expensive items in a given dataset in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function that takes two parameters: a list of items (where each item is a dictionary containing at least a 'name' and a 'price') and an integer n representing the number of expensive items to return.

2. **Sort the Items**: Use Python's built-in sorting capabilities to sort the list of items based on their price. You can use the `sorted()` function or the `sort()` method of the list. When sorting, you should specify that the sorting should be done in descending order based on the 'price' key.

3. **Select the Top n Items**: After sorting, you can slice the sorted list to get the first n items, which will be the most expensive ones.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the sliced list containing the n most expensive items.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def expensive_items(items, n):
    # Sort the items by price in descending order
    sorted_items = sorted(items, key=lambda x: x['price'], reverse=True)
    # Return the top n items
    return sorted_items[:n]
```

This function will fulfill the requirement as specified in the assertion example provided.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

assert expensive_items([{'name': 'Item-1', 'price': 101.1},{'name': 'Item-2', 'price': 555.22}],1)==[{'name': 'Item-2', 'price': 555.22}]
"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the n most expensive items in a given dataset in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function that takes two parameters: a list of items (where each item is a dictionary containing at least a 'name' and a 'price') and an integer n representing the number of expensive items to return.

2. **Sort the Items**: Use Python's built-in sorting capabilities to sort the list of items based on their price. You can use the `sorted()` function or the `sort()` method of the list. When sorting, you should specify that the sorting should be done in descending order based on the 'price' key.

3. **Select the Top n Items**: After sorting, you can slice the sorted list to get the first n items, which will be the most expensive ones.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the sliced list containing the n most expensive items.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def expensive_items(items, n):
    # Sort the items by price in descending order
    sorted_items = sorted(items, key=lambda x: x['price'], reverse=True)
    # Return the top n items
    return sorted_items[:n]
```

This function will fulfill the requirement as specified in the assertion example provided.
