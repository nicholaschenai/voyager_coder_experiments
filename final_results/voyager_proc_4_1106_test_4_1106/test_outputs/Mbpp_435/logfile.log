INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/435 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a python function to find the last digit of a given number.
assert last_Digit(123) == 3
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/435 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the last digit of a given number in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function named `last_Digit` that takes one parameter, which will be the number from which you want to extract the last digit.

2. **Extract the Last Digit**: To find the last digit of a number, you can use the modulus operator (`%`). The expression `number % 10` will give you the remainder when the number is divided by 10, which is effectively the last digit of that number.

3. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the result from the function.

4. **Testing the Function**: Use an assertion to test the function with a sample input to ensure it works as expected.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def last_Digit(number):
    return number % 10

# Example assertion to test the function
assert last_Digit(123) == 3
```

This function will correctly return the last digit of the input number.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function named `last_Digit` that takes one parameter, which will be the number from which you want to extract the last digit.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/435 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct approach to solve the task. We will define a function named `last_Digit` that takes an integer as input and returns the last digit of that number by using the modulus operator `%`.

1) Define the function `last_Digit` that takes one argument, `number`.
2) Inside the function, return the result of `number % 10` to get the last digit.
3) The assertion provided in the task will be used to test the function.
