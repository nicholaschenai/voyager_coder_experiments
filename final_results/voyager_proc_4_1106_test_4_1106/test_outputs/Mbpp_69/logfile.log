Write a function to check whether a list contains the given sublist or not.
assert is_sublist([2,4,3,5,7],[3,7])==False
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/69 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of checking whether a list contains a given sublist in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `is_sublist` that takes two parameters: the main list and the sublist.

2. **Iterate Through the Main List**: Use a loop to iterate through the main list. For each position in the main list, check if the sublist can fit starting from that position.

3. **Check for Sublist Match**: For each starting position, compare the elements of the main list with the elements of the sublist. You can use slicing to extract a portion of the main list that matches the length of the sublist and compare it.

4. **Return Result**: If a match is found, return `True`. If the loop completes without finding a match, return `False`.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def is_sublist(main_list, sublist):
    sublist_length = len(sublist)
    for i in range(len(main_list) - sublist_length + 1):
        if main_list[i:i + sublist_length] == sublist:
            return True
    return False
```

In this function:
- We calculate the length of the sublist.
- We loop through the main list, ensuring we don't go out of bounds.
- We use slicing to compare the relevant portion of the main list with the sublist.
- Finally, we return `True` if a match is found, otherwise `False`.

This approach effectively checks for the presence of the sublist within the main list.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/69 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan for implementing the `is_sublist` function.
