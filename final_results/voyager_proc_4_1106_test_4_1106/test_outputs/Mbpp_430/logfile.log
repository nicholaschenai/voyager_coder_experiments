"""
Write a function to find the directrix of a parabola.
assert parabola_directrix(5,3,2)==-198
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/430 [generation text] Answer: To find the directrix of a parabola given its standard form, we need to understand the parameters involved. A parabola can be represented in the form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) or in vertex form \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \), where \((h, k)\) is the vertex of the parabola.

The directrix of a parabola is a line that is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry and is located at a distance from the vertex that is equal to the distance from the vertex to the focus. For a parabola that opens upwards or downwards, the directrix can be calculated using the formula:

- If the parabola opens upwards, the directrix is given by \( y = k - \frac{1}{4p} \), where \( p \) is the distance from the vertex to the focus.
- If the parabola opens downwards, the directrix is given by \( y = k + \frac{1}{4p} \).

In your case, the function `parabola_directrix(a, b, c)` likely needs to calculate the vertex of the parabola first, then determine the value of \( p \) based on the coefficient \( a \), and finally compute the directrix.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual outline of the function:

1. **Calculate the vertex**: The vertex \((h, k)\) can be found using the formulas:
   - \( h = -\frac{b}{2a} \)
   - \( k = f(h) = a(h^2) + b(h) + c \)

2. **Determine the value of \( p \)**: For a parabola in the form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), \( p \) can be calculated as \( p = \frac{1}{4a} \).

3. **Calculate the directrix**: Depending on the orientation of the parabola (upward or downward), use the appropriate formula for the directrix.

4. **Return the directrix value**.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic:

```python
def parabola_directrix(a, b, c):
    # Step 1: Calculate the vertex
    h = -b / (2 * a)
    k = a * (h ** 2) + b * h + c
    
    # Step 2: Calculate p
    p = 1 / (4 * a)
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the directrix
    directrix = k - p  # For upward opening parabola
    
    return directrix

# Example usage
assert parabola_directrix(5, 3, 2) == -198
```

This function should correctly compute the directrix for the given parameters. Adjust the directrix calculation if the parabola opens downwards or if the formula needs to be modified based on specific requirements.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/430 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a general idea of how to find the directrix of a parabola given its standard form equation. However, it does not account for the possibility of a parabola opening downwards, which would require a different calculation for the directrix. The context assumes the parabola opens upwards, which may not always be the case. The formula for the directrix also seems to be incorrect as it does not consider the correct formula for \( p \) which is the focal length and is given by \( p = \frac{1}{4a} \) if the parabola opens upwards and \( p = -\frac{1}{4a} \) if it opens downwards.

Plan:
1) Calculate the vertex (h, k) of the parabola using the given coefficients a, b, and c.
2) Determine the value of \( p \) based on the coefficient \( a \). If \( a \) is positive, the parabola opens upwards and \( p = \frac{1}{4a} \). If \( a \) is negative, the parabola opens downwards and \( p = -\frac{1}{4a} \).
3) Calculate the directrix using the formula \( y = k - p \) if the parabola opens upwards, and \( y = k + p \) if it opens downwards.
4) Return the y-coordinate of the directrix.

Code:
```python
def parabola_directrix(a, b, c):
    # Step 1: Calculate the vertex (h, k)
    h = -b / (2 * a)
    k = a * h**2 + b * h + c
    
    # Step 2: Determine the value of p based on the orientation of the parabola
    p = 1 / (4 * a) if a > 0 else -1 / (4 * a)

    return int(directrix)

# Example usage

This function should correctly compute the directrix for the given parameters, taking into account the orientation of the parabola. The result is cast to an integer since the assert statement expects an integer value.

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

In your case, the function `parabola_directrix(a, b, c)` likely needs to calculate the vertex of the parabola first, then determine the value of \( p \) based on the coefficient \( a \), and finally compute the directrix.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual outline of the function:

1. **Calculate the vertex**: The vertex \((h, k)\) can be found using the formulas:
   - \( h = -\frac{b}{2a} \)
   - \( k = f(h) = a(h^2) + b(h) + c \)

3. **Calculate the directrix**: Depending on the orientation of the parabola (upward or downward), use the appropriate formula for the directrix.

4. **Return the directrix value**.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic:

Write a function to find the directrix of a parabola.
assert parabola_directrix(5,3,2)==-198
"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To find the directrix of a parabola given its standard form, we need to understand the parameters involved. A parabola can be represented in the form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) or in vertex form \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \), where \((h, k)\) is the vertex of the parabola.

The directrix of a parabola is a line that is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry and is located at a distance from the vertex that is equal to the distance from the vertex to the focus. For a parabola that opens upwards or downwards, the directrix can be calculated using the formula:

- If the parabola opens upwards, the directrix is given by \( y = k - \frac{1}{4p} \), where \( p \) is the distance from the vertex to the focus.
- If the parabola opens downwards, the directrix is given by \( y = k + \frac{1}{4p} \).

In your case, the function `parabola_directrix(a, b, c)` likely needs to calculate the vertex of the parabola first, then determine the value of \( p \) based on the coefficient \( a \), and finally compute the directrix.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual outline of the function:

1. **Calculate the vertex**: The vertex \((h, k)\) can be found using the formulas:
   - \( h = -\frac{b}{2a} \)
   - \( k = f(h) = a(h^2) + b(h) + c \)

2. **Determine the value of \( p \)**: For a parabola in the form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), \( p \) can be calculated as \( p = \frac{1}{4a} \).

3. **Calculate the directrix**: Depending on the orientation of the parabola (upward or downward), use the appropriate formula for the directrix.

4. **Return the directrix value**.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic:

```python
def parabola_directrix(a, b, c):
    # Step 1: Calculate the vertex
    h = -b / (2 * a)
    k = a * (h ** 2) + b * h + c
    
    # Step 2: Calculate p
    p = 1 / (4 * a)
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the directrix
    directrix = k - p  # For upward opening parabola
    
    return directrix

# Example usage
assert parabola_directrix(5, 3, 2) == -198
```

This function should correctly compute the directrix for the given parameters. Adjust the directrix calculation if the parabola opens downwards or if the formula needs to be modified based on specific requirements.


[Critique]
To correct the implementation, the value of 'p' should be derived from the focal parameter of the parabola, which is related to the coefficient 'a' but not simply 1/(4*a). The correct formula for 'p' in an upward opening parabola is '1/(4a)'. Additionally, the orientation check and the conditional logic for 'p' and 'directrix' should be removed, as they are not needed for this task. The directrix should be calculated using the formula 'k - (1/(4*a))' directly.


INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/430 [generation text] Explain: The previous implementation incorrectly calculated the value of `p` and the directrix. The value of `p` should be `1/(4*a)` for a parabola that opens upwards (which is the case when `a` is positive) and the directrix should be `k - p`. The previous code also incorrectly cast the directrix to an integer, which could lead to incorrect results if the directrix is not an integer value.

Plan:
1) Calculate the vertex `h` using the formula `h = -b / (2 * a)`.
2) Calculate the vertex `k` using the formula `k = a * h^2 + b * h + c`.
3) Calculate the value of `p` using the formula `p = 1 / (4 * a)`.
4) Calculate the directrix using the formula `directrix = k - p`.
5) Return the directrix without casting it to an integer, as the directrix can be a floating-point number.

Code:
```python
def parabola_directrix(a, b, c):
    # Step 1: Calculate the vertex h
    h = -b / (2 * a)
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the vertex k
    k = a * h**2 + b * h + c

"""
Write a function to find the directrix of a parabola.
assert parabola_directrix(5,3,2)==-198
"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To find the directrix of a parabola given its standard form, we need to understand the parameters involved. A parabola can be represented in the form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) or in vertex form \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \), where \((h, k)\) is the vertex of the parabola.

The directrix of a parabola is a line that is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry and is located at a distance from the vertex that is equal to the distance from the vertex to the focus. For a parabola that opens upwards or downwards, the directrix can be calculated using the formula:

- If the parabola opens upwards, the directrix is given by \( y = k - \frac{1}{4p} \), where \( p \) is the distance from the vertex to the focus.
- If the parabola opens downwards, the directrix is given by \( y = k + \frac{1}{4p} \).

In your case, the function `parabola_directrix(a, b, c)` likely needs to calculate the vertex of the parabola first, then determine the value of \( p \) based on the coefficient \( a \), and finally compute the directrix.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual outline of the function:

1. **Calculate the vertex**: The vertex \((h, k)\) can be found using the formulas:
   - \( h = -\frac{b}{2a} \)
   - \( k = f(h) = a(h^2) + b(h) + c \)

2. **Determine the value of \( p \)**: For a parabola in the form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), \( p \) can be calculated as \( p = \frac{1}{4a} \).

3. **Calculate the directrix**: Depending on the orientation of the parabola (upward or downward), use the appropriate formula for the directrix.

4. **Return the directrix value**.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic:

```python
def parabola_directrix(a, b, c):
    # Step 1: Calculate the vertex
    h = -b / (2 * a)
    k = a * (h ** 2) + b * h + c
    
    # Step 2: Calculate p
    p = 1 / (4 * a)
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the directrix
    directrix = k - p  # For upward opening parabola
    
    return directrix

# Example usage
assert parabola_directrix(5, 3, 2) == -198
```

This function should correctly compute the directrix for the given parameters. Adjust the directrix calculation if the parabola opens downwards or if the formula needs to be modified based on specific requirements.


[Critique]
The formula for the directrix of a parabola given in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c is not simply k - p. The value of p should be derived from the focal length, which is related to the coefficient a, but not as 1 / (4 * a). The correct approach is to use the formula p = -1 / (4 * a) if the parabola opens downwards, and p = 1 / (4 * a) if it opens upwards. The directrix is then k - p for an upward opening parabola and k + p for a downward opening parabola. The implementation should be corrected to use the right formula for p and to determine the correct orientation of the parabola.


INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/430 [generation text] Explain: The previous implementation of the `parabola_directrix` function incorrectly calculated the directrix. The formula used for `p` was incorrect, and the orientation of the parabola was not taken into account. The directrix for a parabola given by the equation \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) is \( y = k - p \) if the parabola opens upwards (i.e., \( a > 0 \)) and \( y = k + p \) if it opens downwards (i.e., \( a < 0 \)). The value of \( p \) is \( \frac{1}{4|a|} \), not \( \frac{1}{4a} \).

1) Calculate the vertex (h, k) using the formulas \( h = -\frac{b}{2a} \) and \( k = a(h^2) + bh + c \).
2) Determine the value of \( p \) as \( p = \frac{1}{4|a|} \).
3) Calculate the directrix using the correct formula based on the orientation of the parabola.

[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

Write a function to find the directrix of a parabola.
assert parabola_directrix(5,3,2)==-198
"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To find the directrix of a parabola given its standard form, we need to understand the parameters involved. A parabola can be represented in the form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) or in vertex form \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \), where \((h, k)\) is the vertex of the parabola.

The directrix of a parabola is a line that is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry and is located at a distance from the vertex that is equal to the distance from the vertex to the focus. For a parabola that opens upwards or downwards, the directrix can be calculated using the formula:

- If the parabola opens upwards, the directrix is given by \( y = k - \frac{1}{4p} \), where \( p \) is the distance from the vertex to the focus.
- If the parabola opens downwards, the directrix is given by \( y = k + \frac{1}{4p} \).

In your case, the function `parabola_directrix(a, b, c)` likely needs to calculate the vertex of the parabola first, then determine the value of \( p \) based on the coefficient \( a \), and finally compute the directrix.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual outline of the function:

1. **Calculate the vertex**: The vertex \((h, k)\) can be found using the formulas:
   - \( h = -\frac{b}{2a} \)
   - \( k = f(h) = a(h^2) + b(h) + c \)

2. **Determine the value of \( p \)**: For a parabola in the form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), \( p \) can be calculated as \( p = \frac{1}{4a} \).

3. **Calculate the directrix**: Depending on the orientation of the parabola (upward or downward), use the appropriate formula for the directrix.

4. **Return the directrix value**.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic:

```python
def parabola_directrix(a, b, c):
    # Step 1: Calculate the vertex
    h = -b / (2 * a)
    k = a * (h ** 2) + b * h + c
    
    # Step 2: Calculate p
    p = 1 / (4 * a)
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the directrix
    directrix = k - p  # For upward opening parabola
    
    return directrix

# Example usage
assert parabola_directrix(5, 3, 2) == -198
```

This function should correctly compute the directrix for the given parameters. Adjust the directrix calculation if the parabola opens downwards or if the formula needs to be modified based on specific requirements.


[Critique]
The formula for 'p' should be derived from the focal length of the parabola, which is related to the coefficient 'a' by the formula p = 1/(4a) for a parabola that opens upwards or downwards. However, the implementation incorrectly uses the absolute value of 'a', which is not necessary. Additionally, the directrix should be a line, not a single value, and the formula used to calculate 'k' is incorrect. The correct formula for 'k' should be c - (b^2)/(4a). To fix the implementation, use the correct formula for 'k' and remove the absolute value from 'a' when calculating 'p'.


INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/430 [generation text] Explain: The previous implementation of the function `parabola_directrix` incorrectly calculated the value of `p` using the absolute value of `a`. The formula for `p` should be `1/(4a)` without taking the absolute value of `a`. Additionally, the formula for `k` was incorrect. The correct formula for `k` is `c - (b^2)/(4a)`, which represents the y-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola.

1) Calculate the vertex `h` using the formula `h = -b / (2 * a)`.
2) Calculate the vertex `k` using the formula `k = c - (b^2) / (4 * a)`.
3) Calculate the value of `p` using the formula `p = 1 / (4 * a)`.

[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

For an upward opening parabola, the directrix is y = k - p, and for a downward opening parabola, it is y = k + p. The function should return the y-value of the directrix line, not just a single point."
