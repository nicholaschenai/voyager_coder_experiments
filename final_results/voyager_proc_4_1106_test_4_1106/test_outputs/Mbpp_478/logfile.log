"""
Write a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string.
assert remove_lowercase("PYTHon")==('PYTH')
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/478 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of removing lowercase substrings from a given string in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function named `remove_lowercase` that takes a single string argument.

2. **Iterate Through the String**: Use a loop to iterate through each character in the string. You can also use a list comprehension for a more concise approach.

3. **Check Character Case**: For each character, check if it is an uppercase letter. In Python, you can use the `isupper()` method to determine if a character is uppercase.

4. **Build the Result**: Create a new string that consists only of the uppercase characters. You can do this by appending the uppercase characters to a list and then joining them together at the end.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the new string that contains only the uppercase characters.

Here is a conceptual example of how the function might look:

```python
def remove_lowercase(s):
    # Use a list comprehension to filter out lowercase characters
    result = ''.join([char for char in s if char.isupper()])
    return result
```

In this example, the function `remove_lowercase` takes the input string `s`, filters out the lowercase characters, and returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters. The assertion `assert remove_lowercase("PYTHon") == 'PYTH'` would pass, confirming that the function works as intended.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
