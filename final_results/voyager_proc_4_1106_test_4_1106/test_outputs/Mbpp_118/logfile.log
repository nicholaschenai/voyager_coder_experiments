"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/118 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of converting a string to a list of strings split on the space character in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function named `string_to_list` that takes a single parameter, which will be the input string.

2. **Use the `split` Method**: Inside the function, utilize the built-in `split()` method of string objects. This method, when called without any arguments, splits the string at each occurrence of whitespace (including spaces, tabs, and newlines) and returns a list of the resulting substrings.

3. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the list generated by the `split()` method.

4. **Testing the Function**: You can use an assertion to test the function by checking if the output of the function matches the expected list.

Here is a conceptual outline of the code:

```python
def string_to_list(input_string):
    return input_string.split()  # Split the string by whitespace and return the list

# Example usage and assertion
assert string_to_list("python programming") == ['python', 'programming']
```

This function will successfully convert the input string into a list of words split by spaces.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
