"""
Write a python function to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times.
assert odd_Equivalent("011001",6) == 3
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/109 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string a given number of times, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understanding Binary Strings**: A binary string consists of '0's and '1's. Each rotation of the string shifts the characters to the left or right, wrapping around the ends.

2. **Rotating the String**: You need to create a function that can generate all possible rotations of the binary string. For a string of length `n`, there will be `n` unique rotations.

3. **Converting to Decimal**: For each rotation, convert the binary string to its decimal equivalent using Python's built-in `int()` function with base 2.

4. **Checking for Odd Values**: Determine if the decimal value is odd. A number is odd if it is not divisible by 2 (i.e., `number % 2 != 0`).

5. **Counting Odd Values**: Maintain a count of how many of the rotated values are odd.

6. **Returning the Count**: Finally, return the count of odd values.

Here is a high-level outline of the function:

```python
def odd_Equivalent(binary_string, rotations):
    n = len(binary_string)
    odd_count = 0
    
    # Generate all rotations
    for i in range(n):
        rotated_string = binary_string[i:] + binary_string[:i]  # Rotate the string
        decimal_value = int(rotated_string, 2)  # Convert to decimal
        if decimal_value % 2 != 0:  # Check if odd
            odd_count += 1  # Increment count if odd
    
    return odd_count
```

In this function, you would call `odd_Equivalent("011001", 6)` to get the expected result of 3, as specified in the assertion.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/109 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a rough plan that seems to be on the right track. However, it suggests generating all possible rotations of the binary string, which is not necessary. We only need to generate as many rotations as specified by the `rotations` parameter. Additionally, the context's code snippet rotates the string `n` times, where `n` is the length of the string, but the task specifies that we should rotate the string the number of times given by the `rotations` parameter. We need to adjust the code to rotate the string exactly `rotations` times and check for odd values.

Plan:
1) Define the function `odd_Equivalent` that takes a binary string and a number of rotations as parameters.
2) Inside the function, create a loop that will rotate the string the specified number of times.
3) For each rotation, convert the binary string to a decimal number.
4) Check if the decimal number is odd and increment a counter if it is.
5) Return the counter after all rotations have been processed.

Code:
```python
def odd_Equivalent(binary_string, rotations):
    odd_count = 0
    for i in range(rotations):
        # Rotate the string by one position to the left
        binary_string = binary_string[1:] + binary_string[0]
        # Convert to decimal
        decimal_value = int(binary_string, 2)
        # Check if odd and increment count
        if decimal_value % 2 != 0:
            odd_count += 1
    return odd_count
```

This function will rotate the binary string to the left by one position for the specified number of rotations, convert each rotation to a decimal number, check if it's odd, and count the number of odd values.
