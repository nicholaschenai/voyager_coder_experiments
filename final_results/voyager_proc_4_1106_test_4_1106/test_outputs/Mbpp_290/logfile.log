"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/290 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the list of maximum length in a list of lists in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a list of lists as an argument.

2. **Initialize Variables**: Inside the function, initialize two variables: one to keep track of the maximum length found (`max_len`) and another to store the corresponding list (`max_list`).

3. **Iterate Through the Lists**: Use a loop to iterate through each list in the input list of lists. For each list, check its length.

4. **Update Maximum Length**: If the length of the current list is greater than the `max_len`, update `max_len` with the new length and set `max_list` to the current list.

5. **Return the Result**: After checking all lists, return a tuple containing the maximum length and the corresponding list.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def max_length(lists):
    max_len = 0
    max_list = []
    
    for lst in lists:
        if len(lst) > max_len:
            max_len = len(lst)
            max_list = lst
            
    return (max_len, max_list)
```

This function will correctly identify the longest list and return its length along with the list itself, as shown in the assertion example.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the list of maximum length in a list of lists in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a list of lists as an argument.

2. **Initialize Variables**: Inside the function, initialize two variables: one to keep track of the maximum length found (`max_len`) and another to store the corresponding list (`max_list`).

3. **Iterate Through the Lists**: Use a loop to iterate through each list in the input list of lists. For each list, check its length.

4. **Update Maximum Length**: If the length of the current list is greater than the `max_len`, update `max_len` with the new length and set `max_list` to the current list.

5. **Return the Result**: After checking all lists, return a tuple containing the maximum length and the corresponding list.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def max_length(lists):
    max_len = 0
    max_list = []
    
    for lst in lists:
        if len(lst) > max_len:
            max_len = len(lst)
            max_list = lst
            
    return (max_len, max_list)
```

This function will correctly identify the longest list and return its length along with the list itself, as shown in the assertion example.
