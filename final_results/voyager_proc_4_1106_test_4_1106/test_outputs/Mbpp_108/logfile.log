INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/108 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of merging three lists into a single sorted list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Combine the Lists**: Start by concatenating the three input lists into a single list. This can be done using the `+` operator or the `extend()` method.

2. **Sort the Combined List**: Once you have a single list containing all the elements from the three lists, you can sort this list. Python provides a built-in `sort()` method that sorts the list in place, or you can use the `sorted()` function, which returns a new sorted list.

3. **Return the Sorted List**: Finally, return the sorted list as the output of your function.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def merge_sorted_list(list1, list2, list3):
    # Step 1: Combine the lists
    combined_list = list1 + list2 + list3
    
    # Step 2: Sort the combined list
    sorted_list = sorted(combined_list)
    
    # Step 3: Return the sorted list
    return sorted_list
```

This function will take three lists as input, merge them, sort the resulting list, and return the sorted list, which meets the requirements of the assertion provided in the question.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of merging three lists into a single sorted list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Combine the Lists**: Start by concatenating the three input lists into a single list. This can be done using the `+` operator or the `extend()` method.

2. **Sort the Combined List**: Once you have a single list containing all the elements from the three lists, you can sort this list. Python provides a built-in `sort()` method that sorts the list in place, or you can use the `sorted()` function, which returns a new sorted list.

3. **Return the Sorted List**: Finally, return the sorted list as the output of your function.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def merge_sorted_list(list1, list2, list3):
    # Step 1: Combine the lists
    combined_list = list1 + list2 + list3
    
    # Step 2: Sort the combined list
    sorted_list = sorted(combined_list)
    
    # Step 3: Return the sorted list
    return sorted_list
```

This function will take three lists as input, merge them, sort the resulting list, and return the sorted list, which meets the requirements of the assertion provided in the question.
