"""
Write a function to remove all whitespaces from a string.

"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/800 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of removing all whitespaces from a string in Python, you can define a function called `remove_all_spaces`. The function will take a string as an input and return a new string with all whitespace characters removed.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of how to implement this:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function named `remove_all_spaces` that accepts a single parameter (the input string).

2. **Use String Methods**: You can utilize the `replace()` method of string objects to replace all occurrences of whitespace with an empty string. Alternatively, you can use the `join()` method combined with `split()` to achieve the same result.

3. **Return the Result**: After processing the string to remove whitespaces, return the modified string.

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of the function:

```python
def remove_all_spaces(input_string):
    return input_string.replace(' ', '')
```

Or using `join()` and `split()`:

```python
def remove_all_spaces(input_string):
    return ''.join(input_string.split())
```

4. **Testing the Function**: You can use an assertion to test if the function works as expected, as shown in the provided example.

By following these steps, you can effectively create a function that removes all whitespaces from a given string.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
