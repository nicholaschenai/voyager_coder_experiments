"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/265 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of splitting a list into sublists based on every nth element, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function that takes two parameters: the list to be split and the integer n.

2. **Initialize Sublists**: Create an empty list to hold the resulting sublists.

3. **Iterate Over the List**: Use a loop to iterate through the indices of the original list. You can use the `range` function to generate indices that step by n.

4. **Create Sublists**: For each index generated, create a sublist by collecting elements from the original list that are spaced by n. This can be done using a nested loop or a list comprehension.

5. **Return the Result**: After constructing all the sublists, return the list of these sublists.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def list_split(input_list, n):
    # Initialize a list to hold the resulting sublists
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over the range of n
    for i in range(n):
        # Create a sublist starting from index i and stepping by n
        sublist = [input_list[j] for j in range(i, len(input_list), n)]
        result.append(sublist)
    
    return result
```

This function will effectively split the input list into sublists, each containing elements that are n positions apart, as demonstrated in the provided assertion.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
