"""
Given a list of tuples, write a function that returns the first value of the tuple with the smallest second value.
assert index_minimum([('Rash', 143), ('Manjeet', 200), ('Varsha', 100)]) == 'Varsha'
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/94 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the first value of the tuple with the smallest second value in a list of tuples, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function that takes a list of tuples as an argument.

2. **Initialize Variables**: You may want to initialize a variable to keep track of the minimum second value found so far and another variable to store the corresponding first value.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to go through each tuple in the list. For each tuple, compare its second value with the current minimum second value.

4. **Update Minimum Values**: If the second value of the current tuple is smaller than the current minimum, update both the minimum second value and the corresponding first value.

5. **Return the Result**: After iterating through all the tuples, return the first value associated with the smallest second value.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic:

```python
def index_minimum(tuples_list):
    min_value = float('inf')  # Start with infinity as the minimum
    min_first_value = None      # This will hold the first value of the tuple with the smallest second value
    
    for first, second in tuples_list:
        if second < min_value:  # Check if the current second value is less than the minimum found
            min_value = second   # Update the minimum second value
            min_first_value = first  # Update the corresponding first value
            
    return min_first_value  # Return the first value of the tuple with the smallest second value
```

This function will correctly return 'Varsha' for the provided example.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the first value of the tuple with the smallest second value in a list of tuples, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function that takes a list of tuples as an argument.

2. **Initialize Variables**: You may want to initialize a variable to keep track of the minimum second value found so far and another variable to store the corresponding first value.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to go through each tuple in the list. For each tuple, compare its second value with the current minimum second value.

4. **Update Minimum Values**: If the second value of the current tuple is smaller than the current minimum, update both the minimum second value and the corresponding first value.

5. **Return the Result**: After iterating through all the tuples, return the first value associated with the smallest second value.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic:

```python
def index_minimum(tuples_list):
    min_value = float('inf')  # Start with infinity as the minimum
    min_first_value = None      # This will hold the first value of the tuple with the smallest second value
    
    for first, second in tuples_list:
        if second < min_value:  # Check if the current second value is less than the minimum found
            min_value = second   # Update the minimum second value
            min_first_value = first  # Update the corresponding first value
            
    return min_first_value  # Return the first value of the tuple with the smallest second value
```

This function will correctly return 'Varsha' for the provided example.
