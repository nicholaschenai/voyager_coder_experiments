"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/607 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of searching a string for a regex pattern in Python, you can use the `re` module, which provides support for regular expressions. Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of how to implement the function:

1. **Import the `re` module**: This module contains functions that allow you to work with regular expressions.

2. **Define the function**: Create a function named `find_literals` that takes two parameters: the input string and the regex pattern.

3. **Use `re.search()`**: Inside the function, use `re.search()` to search for the regex pattern in the input string. This function returns a match object if the pattern is found, or `None` if it is not.

4. **Extract the matching substring and indices**: If a match is found, you can use the match object to get the matching substring using the `.group()` method, and the start and end indices using the `.start()` and `.end()` methods, respectively.

5. **Return the results**: Finally, return a tuple containing the matching substring, the start index, and the end index.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual example of how the function might look:

```python
import re

def find_literals(input_string, pattern):
    match = re.search(pattern, input_string)
    if match:
        return (match.group(), match.start(), match.end())
    else:
        return None  # or handle the case where no match is found
```

In this example, if you call `find_literals('The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.', 'fox')`, it will return `('fox', 16, 19)` as expected.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of searching a string for a regex pattern in Python, you can use the `re` module, which provides support for regular expressions. Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of how to implement the function:

1. **Import the `re` module**: This module contains functions that allow you to work with regular expressions.

2. **Define the function**: Create a function named `find_literals` that takes two parameters: the input string and the regex pattern.

3. **Use `re.search()`**: Inside the function, use `re.search()` to search for the regex pattern in the input string. This function returns a match object if the pattern is found, or `None` if it is not.

4. **Extract the matching substring and indices**: If a match is found, you can use the match object to get the matching substring using the `.group()` method, and the start and end indices using the `.start()` and `.end()` methods, respectively.

5. **Return the results**: Finally, return a tuple containing the matching substring, the start index, and the end index.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual example of how the function might look:

```python
import re

def find_literals(input_string, pattern):
    match = re.search(pattern, input_string)
    if match:
        return (match.group(), match.start(), match.end())
    else:
        return None  # or handle the case where no match is found
```

In this example, if you call `find_literals('The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.', 'fox')`, it will return `('fox', 16, 19)` as expected.
