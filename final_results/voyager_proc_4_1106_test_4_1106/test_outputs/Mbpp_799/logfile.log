"""
Write a function to that rotate left bits by d bits a given number. We assume that the number is 32 bit.
assert left_rotate(16,2) == 64
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/799 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of rotating the bits of a given number to the left by a specified number of positions in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand Bit Rotation**: Rotating bits to the left means that the bits that overflow from the leftmost side will wrap around to the rightmost side. For example, if you have a binary number and you rotate it left by 2 bits, the leftmost 2 bits will move to the rightmost position.

2. **Use Bitwise Operations**: You can use bitwise operations to achieve the rotation. Specifically, you can use the left shift (`<<`) and right shift (`>>`) operators.

3. **Masking**: Since we are dealing with a 32-bit number, you need to ensure that the result remains within 32 bits. This can be done using a bitwise AND operation with a mask (in this case, `0xFFFFFFFF`).

4. **Function Implementation**:
   - Shift the number left by `d` bits.
   - Shift the number right by `(32 - d)` bits to get the bits that overflowed.
   - Combine these two results using the bitwise OR operator.

5. **Handle the Rotation Count**: If `d` is greater than 32, you can use `d % 32` to ensure that the rotation count is within the valid range.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def left_rotate(n, d):
    # Ensure d is within the range of 0-31
    d = d % 32
    # Perform the left rotation
    return ((n << d) | (n >> (32 - d))) & 0xFFFFFFFF
```

In this function:
- `n << d` shifts the bits of `n` to the left by `d` positions.
- `n >> (32 - d)` shifts the bits of `n` to the right by `(32 - d)` positions to get the overflowed bits.
- The bitwise OR combines both results, and the mask `& 0xFFFFFFFF` ensures that the result is treated as a 32-bit number.

With this approach, you can achieve the desired left rotation of bits for a given number.

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

Write a function to that rotate left bits by d bits a given number. We assume that the number is 32 bit.
assert left_rotate(16,2) == 64
"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of rotating the bits of a given number to the left by a specified number of positions in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand Bit Rotation**: Rotating bits to the left means that the bits that overflow from the leftmost side will wrap around to the rightmost side. For example, if you have a binary number and you rotate it left by 2 bits, the leftmost 2 bits will move to the rightmost position.

2. **Use Bitwise Operations**: You can use bitwise operations to achieve the rotation. Specifically, you can use the left shift (`<<`) and right shift (`>>`) operators.

3. **Masking**: Since we are dealing with a 32-bit number, you need to ensure that the result remains within 32 bits. This can be done using a bitwise AND operation with a mask (in this case, `0xFFFFFFFF`).

4. **Function Implementation**:
   - Shift the number left by `d` bits.
   - Shift the number right by `(32 - d)` bits to get the bits that overflowed.
   - Combine these two results using the bitwise OR operator.

5. **Handle the Rotation Count**: If `d` is greater than 32, you can use `d % 32` to ensure that the rotation count is within the valid range.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def left_rotate(n, d):
    # Ensure d is within the range of 0-31
    d = d % 32
    # Perform the left rotation
    return ((n << d) | (n >> (32 - d))) & 0xFFFFFFFF
```

In this function:
- `n << d` shifts the bits of `n` to the left by `d` positions.
- `n >> (32 - d)` shifts the bits of `n` to the right by `(32 - d)` positions to get the overflowed bits.
- The bitwise OR combines both results, and the mask `& 0xFFFFFFFF` ensures that the result is treated as a 32-bit number.

With this approach, you can achieve the desired left rotation of bits for a given number.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/799 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a good explanation of how to perform a left bit rotation on a 32-bit number. The steps outlined are correct and can be directly translated into a Python function.

Plan:
1) Define the function `left_rotate` that takes two arguments: `n` (the number to rotate) and `d` (the number of bits to rotate to the left).
2) Normalize `d` to ensure it is within the range of 0 to 31, since rotating by 32 or a multiple of 32 would result in the same number.
3) Perform the left rotation by shifting `n` to the left by `d` bits.
4) Perform a right shift on `n` by `(32 - d)` bits to get the overflowed bits.
5) Combine the results of the left shift and the right shift using the bitwise OR operator.
6) Apply a mask to ensure the result is treated as a 32-bit number.
7) Return the result.

Code:
```python
def left_rotate(n, d):
    # Normalize d to ensure it is within the range of 0 to 31
    d %= 32
    # Perform the left rotation and apply a mask to ensure a 32-bit result
