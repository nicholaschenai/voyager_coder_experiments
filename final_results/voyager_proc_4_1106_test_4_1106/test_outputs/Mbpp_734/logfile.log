"""
Write a python function to find sum of products of all possible sublists of a given list. 
assert sum_Of_Subarray_Prod([1,2,3]) == 20
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/734 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the sum of products of all possible sublists of a given list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Generate Sublists**: You need to generate all possible sublists (or subarrays) of the given list. A sublist can be defined by its starting and ending indices. You can use nested loops to iterate through all possible starting and ending points.

2. **Calculate Product**: For each sublist generated, calculate the product of its elements. You can initialize a product variable to 1 and multiply it by each element in the sublist.

3. **Accumulate the Sum**: Maintain a running total of the products calculated for each sublist. Initialize a sum variable to 0 and add each product to this sum.

4. **Return the Result**: After iterating through all possible sublists, return the accumulated sum.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def sum_Of_Subarray_Prod(lst):
    total_sum = 0
    n = len(lst)
    
    # Generate all sublists
    for start in range(n):
        for end in range(start, n):
            # Calculate the product of the current sublist
            product = 1
            for i in range(start, end + 1):
                product *= lst[i]
            # Add the product to the total sum
            total_sum += product
            
    return total_sum
```

In this function:
- The outer loop iterates over the starting index of the sublist.
- The inner loop iterates over the ending index.
- The innermost loop calculates the product of the elements in the current sublist.
- Finally, the product is added to the total sum, which is returned at the end.

This approach ensures that you consider all possible sublists and compute their products correctly.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the sum of products of all possible sublists of a given list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Generate Sublists**: You need to generate all possible sublists (or subarrays) of the given list. A sublist can be defined by its starting and ending indices. You can use nested loops to iterate through all possible starting and ending points.

3. **Accumulate the Sum**: Maintain a running total of the products calculated for each sublist. Initialize a sum variable to 0 and add each product to this sum.

4. **Return the Result**: After iterating through all possible sublists, return the accumulated sum.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def sum_Of_Subarray_Prod(lst):
    total_sum = 0
    n = len(lst)
    
    # Generate all sublists

- The inner loop iterates over the ending index.
- The innermost loop calculates the product of the elements in the current sublist.

This approach ensures that you consider all possible sublists and compute their products correctly.
