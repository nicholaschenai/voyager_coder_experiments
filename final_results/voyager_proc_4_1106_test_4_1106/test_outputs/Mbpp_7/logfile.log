"""
Write a function to find all words which are at least 4 characters long in a string.
assert set(find_char_long('Please move back to stream')) == set(['Please', 'move', 'back', 'stream'])
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/7 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding all words that are at least 4 characters long in a given string in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a string as an argument.

2. **Split the String**: Use the `split()` method to break the string into individual words. This method will create a list of words based on whitespace.

3. **Filter Words**: Iterate through the list of words and check the length of each word using the `len()` function. You can use a list comprehension or a loop to collect words that have a length of 4 or more.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the list of filtered words.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def find_char_long(input_string):
    # Step 1: Split the string into words
    words = input_string.split()
    
    # Step 2: Filter words that are at least 4 characters long
    long_words = [word for word in words if len(word) >= 4]
    
    # Step 3: Return the list of long words
    return long_words
```

In this function, `input_string.split()` creates a list of words, and the list comprehension `[word for word in words if len(word) >= 4]` filters out the words that are shorter than 4 characters. The result can then be compared to the expected output using the `assert` statement as shown in your example.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding all words that are at least 4 characters long in a given string in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a string as an argument.

2. **Split the String**: Use the `split()` method to break the string into individual words. This method will create a list of words based on whitespace.

3. **Filter Words**: Iterate through the list of words and check the length of each word using the `len()` function. You can use a list comprehension or a loop to collect words that have a length of 4 or more.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the list of filtered words.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def find_char_long(input_string):
    # Step 1: Split the string into words
    words = input_string.split()
    
    # Step 2: Filter words that are at least 4 characters long
    long_words = [word for word in words if len(word) >= 4]
    
    # Step 3: Return the list of long words
    return long_words
```

In this function, `input_string.split()` creates a list of words, and the list comprehension `[word for word in words if len(word) >= 4]` filters out the words that are shorter than 4 characters. The result can then be compared to the expected output using the `assert` statement as shown in your example.
