"""
Write a function to find the cumulative sum of all the values that are present in the given tuple list.
assert cummulative_sum([(1, 3), (5, 6, 7), (2, 6)]) == 30
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/614 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the cumulative sum of all the values in a given list of tuples in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a list of tuples as an argument.

2. **Initialize a Sum Variable**: Inside the function, initialize a variable to hold the cumulative sum, starting at zero.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to iterate through each tuple in the list.

4. **Iterate Through Each Tuple**: For each tuple, use another loop to iterate through its elements.

5. **Accumulate the Sum**: For each element in the tuple, add its value to the cumulative sum variable.

6. **Return the Result**: After processing all tuples, return the cumulative sum.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def cumulative_sum(tuple_list):
    total = 0  # Step 2: Initialize sum variable
    for tup in tuple_list:  # Step 3: Iterate through the list of tuples
        for num in tup:  # Step 4: Iterate through each tuple
            total += num  # Step 5: Accumulate the sum
    return total  # Step 6: Return the result
```

You can then use this function and assert the result as shown in your example.
