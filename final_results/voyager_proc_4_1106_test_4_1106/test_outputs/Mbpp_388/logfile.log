"""
Write a python function to find the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to n.
assert highest_Power_of_2(10) == 8
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/388 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to a given number `n`, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understanding Powers of 2**: Powers of 2 are numbers like 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. Each of these can be represented as `2^k` where `k` is a non-negative integer.

2. **Iterative Approach**: You can start from the smallest power of 2 (which is 1) and keep multiplying by 2 until you exceed `n`. The last power of 2 that you calculated before exceeding `n` will be the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Implementation**: You can implement this logic in a function. Initialize a variable to hold the current power of 2 (starting at 1) and use a loop to multiply it by 2 until it exceeds `n`. Keep track of the last valid power of 2.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic in Python:

```python
def highest_Power_of_2(n):
    power = 1  # Start with 2^0
    while power * 2 <= n:  # Check if the next power of 2 is still <= n
        power *= 2  # Move to the next power of 2
    return power  # Return the highest power of 2 found

# Example usage
assert highest_Power_of_2(10) == 8
```

In this function, `power` starts at 1 (which is `2^0`), and we keep doubling it until it exceeds `n`. The last value of `power` before the loop exits is the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to a given number `n`, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understanding Powers of 2**: Powers of 2 are numbers like 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. Each of these can be represented as `2^k` where `k` is a non-negative integer.

2. **Iterative Approach**: You can start from the smallest power of 2 (which is 1) and keep multiplying by 2 until you exceed `n`. The last power of 2 that you calculated before exceeding `n` will be the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Implementation**: You can implement this logic in a function. Initialize a variable to hold the current power of 2 (starting at 1) and use a loop to multiply it by 2 until it exceeds `n`. Keep track of the last valid power of 2.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic in Python:

```python
def highest_Power_of_2(n):
    power = 1  # Start with 2^0
    while power * 2 <= n:  # Check if the next power of 2 is still <= n
        power *= 2  # Move to the next power of 2
    return power  # Return the highest power of 2 found

# Example usage
assert highest_Power_of_2(10) == 8
```

In this function, `power` starts at 1 (which is `2^0`), and we keep doubling it until it exceeds `n`. The last value of `power` before the loop exits is the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`.
