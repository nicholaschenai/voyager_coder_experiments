"""
Write a function to find the median length of a trapezium.
assert median_trapezium(15,25,35)==20
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/432 [generation text] Answer: To find the median length of a trapezium (trapezoid), you can use the formula for the median, which is the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides (bases) of the trapezium. In this case, the bases are represented by the first two parameters of the function.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of how to accomplish this task in Python:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `median_trapezium` that takes three parameters: the lengths of the two bases and the height (though the height is not needed for calculating the median).

2. **Calculate the Median**: Inside the function, calculate the median length using the formula:
   \[
   \text{median} = \frac{(b_1 + b_2)}{2}
   \]
   where \(b_1\) and \(b_2\) are the lengths of the two bases.

3. **Return the Result**: Return the calculated median length.

4. **Assertion**: Use the `assert` statement to check if the function returns the expected value for the given inputs.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def median_trapezium(base1, base2, height):
    return (base1 + base2) / 2

# Example assertion
assert median_trapezium(15, 25, 35) == 20
```

In this implementation, the function correctly calculates the median length of the trapezium based on the provided bases. The height parameter is included in the function signature but is not used in the calculation, as it is not necessary for finding the median length.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
