"""
Write a python function to toggle bits of the number except the first and the last bit. 
assert toggle_middle_bits(9) == 15
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/735 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of toggling the bits of a number except for the first and last bits in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Convert the Number to Binary**: First, convert the given number to its binary representation. This will help you visualize the bits that need to be toggled.

2. **Identify the Bits to Toggle**: Determine which bits are the first and last bits. For a binary number, the first bit is the most significant bit (leftmost), and the last bit is the least significant bit (rightmost). You will toggle all bits in between these two.

3. **Toggle the Middle Bits**: Iterate through the binary representation, and for each bit that is not the first or last, toggle it. Toggling a bit means changing a `0` to a `1` and a `1` to a `0`.

4. **Reconstruct the Number**: After toggling the necessary bits, convert the modified binary representation back to a decimal number.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the new number that results from the toggled bits.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def toggle_middle_bits(n):
    # Step 1: Convert to binary and remove the '0b' prefix
    binary = bin(n)[2:]
    
    # Step 2: Create a list to hold the toggled bits
    toggled = list(binary)
    
    # Step 3: Toggle the middle bits
    for i in range(1, len(toggled) - 1):
        toggled[i] = '1' if toggled[i] == '0' else '0'
    
    # Step 4: Join the list back into a string and convert to decimal
    toggled_binary = ''.join(toggled)
    result = int(toggled_binary, 2)
    
    # Step 5: Return the result
    return result

# Example usage
assert toggle_middle_bits(9) == 15  # 9 in binary is 1001, toggling middle gives 1111 which is 15
```

This function will toggle the bits of the number `n` except for the first and last bits, as required.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/735 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a rough plan that seems to be correct for toggling the middle bits of a binary number. We will follow the steps outlined in the context to implement the function.

Plan:
1) Convert the number to its binary representation using the `bin` function and strip the '0b' prefix.
2) Iterate over the binary representation, skipping the first and last characters, and toggle the bits.
3) Join the toggled bits back into a string.
4) Convert the modified binary string back to an integer using the `int` function with base 2.
5) Return the resulting integer.

Code:
```python
def toggle_middle_bits(n):
    # Step 1: Convert to binary and remove the '0b' prefix
    binary = bin(n)[2:]
    
    # Step 2: Toggle the middle bits
    toggled = binary[0] + ''.join('0' if bit == '1' else '1' for bit in binary[1:-1]) + binary[-1]
    
    # Step 3: Convert the toggled binary string back to an integer
    result = int(toggled, 2)
    
    # Step 4: Return the result
