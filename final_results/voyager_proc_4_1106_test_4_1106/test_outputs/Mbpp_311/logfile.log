"""
Write a python function to set the left most unset bit.
assert set_left_most_unset_bit(10) == 14
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/311 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of setting the leftmost unset bit in a given integer in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Identify the Leftmost Unset Bit**: You need to find the position of the leftmost bit that is currently unset (0) in the binary representation of the number. This can be done by repeatedly shifting the number to the right until you find a 0.

2. **Set the Bit**: Once you have identified the position of the leftmost unset bit, you can set that bit to 1. This can be achieved using a bitwise OR operation with a mask that has a 1 at the position of the unset bit.

3. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the modified number with the leftmost unset bit set.

Here is a high-level outline of the function:

```python
def set_left_most_unset_bit(n):
    # Step 1: Find the leftmost unset bit
    position = 0
    while (n & (1 << position)) != 0:
        position += 1
    
    # Step 2: Set the leftmost unset bit
    result = n | (1 << position)
    
    # Step 3: Return the result
    return result
```

In this function:
- We use a loop to check each bit of `n` starting from the least significant bit (rightmost) until we find a bit that is 0.
- The `1 << position` creates a mask with a 1 at the position of the leftmost unset bit.
- The bitwise OR operation (`|`) sets that bit in the original number.

This approach ensures that you correctly identify and set the leftmost unset bit in the integer.

Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.

    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of setting the leftmost unset bit in a given integer in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Identify the Leftmost Unset Bit**: You need to find the position of the leftmost bit that is currently unset (0) in the binary representation of the number. This can be done by repeatedly shifting the number to the right until you find a 0.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/311 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct approach to solve the task. We need to find the leftmost unset bit in the binary representation of the number and then set that bit to 1.

Plan:
1) Initialize a variable `position` to 0, which will be used to find the position of the leftmost unset bit.
2) Use a while loop to iterate over the bits of the number `n`. In each iteration, check if the bit at the current `position` is set (1) by using bitwise AND operation with a mask `1 << position`. If the bit is set, increment the `position`.
3) Once we find the unset bit (the loop condition becomes false), use a bitwise OR operation with a mask `1 << position` to set the leftmost unset bit.

[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

Write a python function to set the left most unset bit.
assert set_left_most_unset_bit(10) == 14
"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of setting the leftmost unset bit in a given integer in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Identify the Leftmost Unset Bit**: You need to find the position of the leftmost bit that is currently unset (0) in the binary representation of the number. This can be done by repeatedly shifting the number to the right until you find a 0.

2. **Set the Bit**: Once you have identified the position of the leftmost unset bit, you can set that bit to 1. This can be achieved using a bitwise OR operation with a mask that has a 1 at the position of the unset bit.

3. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the modified number with the leftmost unset bit set.

Here is a high-level outline of the function:

```python
def set_left_most_unset_bit(n):
    # Step 1: Find the leftmost unset bit
    position = 0
    while (n & (1 << position)) != 0:
        position += 1
    
    # Step 2: Set the leftmost unset bit
    result = n | (1 << position)
    
    # Step 3: Return the result
    return result
```

In this function:
- We use a loop to check each bit of `n` starting from the least significant bit (rightmost) until we find a bit that is 0.
- The `1 << position` creates a mask with a 1 at the position of the leftmost unset bit.
- The bitwise OR operation (`|`) sets that bit in the original number.

This approach ensures that you correctly identify and set the leftmost unset bit in the integer.


[Critique]
The issue in the implementation is that it finds the rightmost unset bit, not the leftmost. To fix this, we need to iterate from the most significant bit towards the least significant bit. We can start the position at the highest possible bit position (e.g., 31 for a 32-bit integer) and decrement it until we find an unset bit. Alternatively, we can use a different approach to find the leftmost unset bit, such as inverting the number, finding the rightmost set bit of the inverted number, and then setting the corresponding bit in the original number.


INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/311 [generation text] Explain: The provided code is indeed setting the rightmost unset bit instead of the leftmost unset bit. The test case failed because the function returned 11 (binary: 1011) instead of the expected 14 (binary: 1110) when the input was 10 (binary: 1010). The leftmost unset bit in 10 is the bit at position 2 (counting from 0), which when set, results in the binary number 1110, which is 14 in decimal.

Plan:
1) Invert the number to find the unset bits.
2) Find the position of the rightmost set bit in the inverted number, which corresponds to the leftmost unset bit in the original number.
3) Set this bit in the original number using a bitwise OR operation.
4) Return the modified number.

Code:
```python
def set_left_most_unset_bit(n):
    # Step 1: Invert the number to find unset bits
    inverted_n = ~n
    
    # Step 2: Find the position of the rightmost set bit in the inverted number
    position = 0
    while inverted_n & (1 << position) == 0:
        position += 1
    
    # Step 3: Set the leftmost unset bit in the original number
    result = n | (1 << position)

You are a Python programming assistant that assesses my progress of Python programming and provides useful guidance.

I will give you the following information:

[Task]: The objective I need to accomplish.
[Context]: The context of the task. Serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help me on the task, but my priority is to follow instructions in the Task tag.
[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

[Critique]
The issue in the implementation is that it starts checking for unset bits from the least significant bit (rightmost) and sets the first unset bit it finds. To set the leftmost unset bit, the function should start checking from the most significant bit (leftmost) and move towards the least significant bit. This can be done by finding the most significant bit that is set in the original number, and then checking for unset bits starting from one position left to this bit.


INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/311 [generation text] Explain: The provided code starts checking for unset bits from the least significant bit (rightmost) and sets the first unset bit it finds. However, the task requires setting the leftmost unset bit, which means we need to start checking from the most significant bit (leftmost) and move towards the least significant bit. The code fails because it incorrectly identifies the leftmost unset bit.

Plan:
1) Find the most significant bit that is set in the original number. This can be done by finding the position of the highest bit set to 1.
2) Start checking for unset bits from one position left to the most significant bit that is set.
3) Once the leftmost unset bit is found, set it to 1 using a bitwise OR operation.
4) Return the modified number with the leftmost unset bit set.

Code:
```python
def set_left_most_unset_bit(n):
    # Step 1: Find the most significant bit that is set
    position = 0
    temp = n
    while temp != 0:
        temp >>= 1
        position += 1
    
    # Step 2: Start checking for unset bits from one position left to the most significant bit that is set
    mask = 1 << (position - 1)
    while mask & n:
        mask >>= 1
    
    # Step 3: Set the leftmost unset bit
    result = n | mask
    
    # Step 4: Return the result
    return result
```
