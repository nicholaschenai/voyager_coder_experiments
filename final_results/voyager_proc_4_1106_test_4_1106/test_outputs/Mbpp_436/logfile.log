INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/436 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a python function to return the negative numbers in a list.
assert neg_nos([-1,4,5,-6]) == [-1,-6]
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/436 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of writing a Python function that returns the negative numbers from a list, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a list as an argument.

2. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to go through each element in the list.

3. **Check for Negativity**: For each element, check if it is less than zero (i.e., a negative number).

4. **Collect Negative Numbers**: If an element is negative, add it to a new list that will store all the negative numbers.

5. **Return the Result**: After iterating through the entire list, return the new list containing only the negative numbers.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps in Python:

```python
def neg_nos(lst):
    return [num for num in lst if num < 0]

# Example usage
assert neg_nos([-1, 4, 5, -6]) == [-1, -6]
```

In this implementation, a list comprehension is used to create a new list that includes only the negative numbers from the input list. The `assert` statement is used to verify that the function works as expected.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
