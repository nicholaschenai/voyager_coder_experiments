INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/239 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the number of possible sequences of length `n` where each element is a positive integer that is at least twice the previous element and at most `m`, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `get_total_number_of_sequences` that takes two parameters, `m` and `n`.

2. **Base Case**: If `n` is 0, return 1, as there is one way to have a sequence of length 0 (the empty sequence).

3. **Recursive Approach**: Use recursion to build the sequences. For each possible starting integer `x` (from 1 to `m`), recursively find the number of valid sequences of length `n-1` that can follow `x`.

4. **Constraints**: For each integer `x`, the next integer in the sequence must be at least `2 * x` and at most `m`. This means you need to check for valid integers in the range `[2 * x, m]`.

5. **Count Valid Sequences**: For each valid starting integer, count how many sequences can be formed by calling the function recursively for the next length (`n-1`).

6. **Memoization**: To optimize the recursive calls, you can use memoization to store results of previously computed sequences for specific values of `m` and `n`.

7. **Return the Count**: Finally, return the total count of valid sequences.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1  # Base case: one way to have a sequence of length 0
    
    total_sequences = 0
    
    # Iterate through all possible starting integers
    for x in range(1, m + 1):
        # Calculate the next valid starting point
        next_start = 2 * x
        if next_start > m:
            break  # No valid next integer can be found
        
        # Count sequences of length n-1 starting from next_start
        total_sequences += get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n - 1)
    
    return total_sequences
```

This function will recursively count the valid sequences while adhering to the constraints provided.

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the number of possible sequences of length `n` where each element is a positive integer that is at least twice the previous element and at most `m`, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `get_total_number_of_sequences` that takes two parameters, `m` and `n`.

2. **Base Case**: If `n` is 0, return 1, as there is one way to have a sequence of length 0 (the empty sequence).

3. **Recursive Approach**: Use recursion to build the sequences. For each possible starting integer `x` (from 1 to `m`), recursively find the number of valid sequences of length `n-1` that can follow `x`.

4. **Constraints**: For each integer `x`, the next integer in the sequence must be at least `2 * x` and at most `m`. This means you need to check for valid integers in the range `[2 * x, m]`.

5. **Count Valid Sequences**: For each valid starting integer, count how many sequences can be formed by calling the function recursively for the next length (`n-1`).

6. **Memoization**: To optimize the recursive calls, you can use memoization to store results of previously computed sequences for specific values of `m` and `n`.

7. **Return the Count**: Finally, return the total count of valid sequences.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python

        return 1  # Base case: one way to have a sequence of length 0
    
    total_sequences = 0
    
    # Iterate through all possible starting integers

        # Calculate the next valid starting point
        next_start = 2 * x
        if next_start > m:
            break  # No valid next integer can be found
        
        # Count sequences of length n-1 starting from next_start
        total_sequences += get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n - 1)

```

This function will recursively count the valid sequences while adhering to the constraints provided.

Plan:

5) Use memoization to store and retrieve the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.
6) Return the total count of valid sequences.
