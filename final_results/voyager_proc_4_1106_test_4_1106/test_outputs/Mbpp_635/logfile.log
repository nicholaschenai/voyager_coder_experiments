"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/635 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of writing a function to sort a given list using the heap sort algorithm in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand Heap Sort**: Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure. It consists of two main phases: building a max heap from the input data and then repeatedly extracting the maximum element from the heap to build the sorted array.

2. **Build a Max Heap**: 
   - A max heap is a complete binary tree where the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children. 
   - You can build a max heap from an unsorted list by iterating from the last non-leaf node down to the root and applying the heapify process.

3. **Heapify Process**: 
   - The heapify process ensures that a subtree rooted at a given index maintains the heap property. If the subtree violates the heap property, you swap the root with the largest of its children and recursively heapify the affected subtree.

4. **Sorting the List**: 
   - Once the max heap is built, the largest element (the root of the heap) is at the front of the list. You can swap it with the last element of the heap and reduce the size of the heap by one. 
   - Then, you call the heapify function on the root of the heap to restore the heap property. Repeat this process until the heap size is reduced to one.

5. **Return the Sorted List**: 
   - After all elements have been extracted from the heap and placed in the correct order, return the sorted list.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def heap_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)

    # Build a max heap
    for i in range(n // 2 - 1, -1, -1):
        heapify(arr, n, i)

    # One by one extract elements from the heap
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        arr[i], arr[0] = arr[0], arr[i]  # Swap
        heapify(arr, i, 0)  # Heapify the root element

    return arr

def heapify(arr, n, i):
    largest = i  # Initialize largest as root
    left = 2 * i + 1  # left = 2*i + 1
    right = 2 * i + 2  # right = 2*i + 2

    # See if left child of root exists and is greater than root
    if left < n and arr[left] > arr[largest]:
        largest = left

    # See if right child of root exists and is greater than root
    if right < n and arr[right] > arr[largest]:
        largest = right

    # Change root, if needed
    if largest != i:
        arr[i], arr[largest] = arr[largest], arr[i]  # Swap
        heapify(arr, n, largest)  # Recursively heapify the affected subtree
```

This function can then be tested with the provided assertion to ensure it works correctly.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.
