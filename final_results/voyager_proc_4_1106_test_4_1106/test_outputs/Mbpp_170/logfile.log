"""
Write a function to find the sum of numbers in a list within a range specified by two indices.
assert sum_range_list([2,1,5,6,8,3,4,9,10,11,8,12], 8, 10) == 29
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/170 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the sum of numbers in a list within a specified range defined by two indices, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `sum_range_list` that takes three parameters: the list of numbers and the two indices that define the range.

2. **Extract the Sublist**: Use the provided indices to slice the list. In Python, you can use list slicing to get a sublist from the original list. The slice will include elements from the start index up to, but not including, the end index.

3. **Calculate the Sum**: Use the built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total of the numbers in the extracted sublist.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the calculated sum.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def sum_range_list(numbers, start_index, end_index):
    # Step 2: Extract the sublist using slicing
    sublist = numbers[start_index:end_index]
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the sum of the sublist
    total_sum = sum(sublist)
    
    # Step 4: Return the result
    return total_sum
```

With this function, you can then use the `assert` statement to verify that the function works as expected with the provided example.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/170 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan for implementing the function. The steps outlined are appropriate for the task at hand.

Plan:
1) Define the function `sum_range_list` with three parameters: `numbers`, `start_index`, and `end_index`.
2) Use list slicing to extract the sublist from `start_index` to `end_index + 1` since the end index in the assertion is inclusive.
3) Calculate the sum of the extracted sublist using the built-in `sum()` function.
4) Return the calculated sum.

Code:
```python
def sum_range_list(numbers, start_index, end_index):
    # Extract the sublist including the element at end_index
    sublist = numbers[start_index:end_index + 1]
    
    # Calculate the sum of the sublist
    total_sum = sum(sublist)
