"""
Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
assert check_Consecutive([1,2,3,4,5]) == True
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/472 [generation text] Answer: To check whether a given list contains consecutive numbers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Sort the List**: First, sort the list of numbers. This will arrange the numbers in ascending order, making it easier to check for consecutiveness.

2. **Check Differences**: After sorting, iterate through the sorted list and check the difference between each consecutive pair of numbers. For a list to contain consecutive numbers, the difference between each pair should be exactly 1.

3. **Return Result**: If all consecutive pairs have a difference of 1, return `True`. If you find any pair that does not meet this condition, return `False`.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic in a Python function:

```python
def check_Consecutive(nums):
    if not nums:  # Handle empty list case
        return False
    nums.sort()  # Step 1: Sort the list
    for i in range(len(nums) - 1):  # Step 2: Check differences
        if nums[i + 1] - nums[i] != 1:
            return False  # Found a gap, not consecutive
    return True  # All pairs were consecutive
```

You can then use the `assert` statement to test the function as shown in your example.

Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To check whether a given list contains consecutive numbers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Sort the List**: First, sort the list of numbers. This will arrange the numbers in ascending order, making it easier to check for consecutiveness.

2. **Check Differences**: After sorting, iterate through the sorted list and check the difference between each consecutive pair of numbers. For a list to contain consecutive numbers, the difference between each pair should be exactly 1.

3. **Return Result**: If all consecutive pairs have a difference of 1, return `True`. If you find any pair that does not meet this condition, return `False`.

```

You can then use the `assert` statement to test the function as shown in your example.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/472 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct approach to solve the task. However, sorting the list is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results if the list contains duplicates. Instead, we can check for consecutiveness by ensuring that the maximum number minus the minimum number plus one equals the length of the list, and also by ensuring that all elements are unique.

Plan:
1) Check if the list is empty; if it is, return False.
2) Find the minimum and maximum values in the list.
3) Check if the difference between the maximum and minimum values plus one equals the length of the list.
4) Use the `has_unique_chars` function to check if all elements in the list are unique.
5) If both conditions are met, return True; otherwise, return False.

Code:
```python
def check_Consecutive(nums):
    if not nums:  # Handle empty list case
        return False
    min_num = min(nums)
    max_num = max(nums)
    # Check if the difference between max and min plus one equals the length of the list
    # and if all elements are unique
    return (max_num - min_num + 1 == len(nums)) and has_unique_chars(nums)

# Reusing the has_unique_chars function from earlier
def has_unique_chars(s):
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range((i + 1), len(s)):
            if (s[i] == s[j]):
                return False
    return True
```

Note: The `has_unique_chars` function was originally designed for strings, but it will work for lists as well since it only relies on indexing and comparison, which are also applicable to lists.
