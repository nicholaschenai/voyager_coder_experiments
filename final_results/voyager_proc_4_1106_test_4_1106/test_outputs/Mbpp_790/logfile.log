"""
Write a python function to check whether every even index contains even numbers of a given list.
assert even_position([3,2,1]) == False
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/790 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of checking whether every even index in a given list contains even numbers, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `even_position` that takes a list as an argument.

2. **Iterate Over Even Indices**: Use a loop to iterate through the indices of the list. Since you are interested in even indices, you can use the `range` function with a step of 2, starting from 0.

3. **Check Even Numbers**: For each even index, check if the corresponding element in the list is an even number. You can determine if a number is even by using the modulus operator (`%`). Specifically, a number `n` is even if `n % 2 == 0`.

4. **Return Result**: If you find any even index that does not contain an even number, return `False`. If all even indices contain even numbers, return `True`.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def even_position(lst):
    for i in range(0, len(lst), 2):  # Iterate over even indices
        if lst[i] % 2 != 0:  # Check if the number at the even index is not even
            return False  # Return False if an odd number is found
    return True  # Return True if all even indices contain even numbers
```

With this function, you can then use the provided assertion to test its correctness. For example, `assert even_position([3, 2, 1]) == False` checks that the function correctly identifies that the number at index 0 (which is 3) is not even.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of checking whether every even index in a given list contains even numbers, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `even_position` that takes a list as an argument.

2. **Iterate Over Even Indices**: Use a loop to iterate through the indices of the list. Since you are interested in even indices, you can use the `range` function with a step of 2, starting from 0.

3. **Check Even Numbers**: For each even index, check if the corresponding element in the list is an even number. You can determine if a number is even by using the modulus operator (`%`). Specifically, a number `n` is even if `n % 2 == 0`.

4. **Return Result**: If you find any even index that does not contain an even number, return `False`. If all even indices contain even numbers, return `True`.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def even_position(lst):
    for i in range(0, len(lst), 2):  # Iterate over even indices
        if lst[i] % 2 != 0:  # Check if the number at the even index is not even
            return False  # Return False if an odd number is found
    return True  # Return True if all even indices contain even numbers
```

With this function, you can then use the provided assertion to test its correctness. For example, `assert even_position([3, 2, 1]) == False` checks that the function correctly identifies that the number at index 0 (which is 3) is not even.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/790 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan to solve the task. The function needs to iterate over the even indices of the list and check if the corresponding elements are even numbers. If any element at an even index is not an even number, the function should return False; otherwise, it should return True after checking all even indices.

Plan:
1) Define the function `even_position` that takes a list as an argument.
2) Use a for loop with a range starting from 0, ending at the length of the list, and with a step of 2 to iterate over even indices.
3) Inside the loop, check if the element at the current index is not an even number by using the modulus operator `%`.
4) If an element at an even index is not even, return False.
5) If the loop completes without returning False, return True, indicating all even indices contain even numbers.

Code:
```python
def even_position(lst):
    for i in range(0, len(lst), 2):  # Iterate over even indices
        if lst[i] % 2 != 0:  # Check if the number at the even index is not even
