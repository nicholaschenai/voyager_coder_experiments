"""
Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
assert is_not_prime(2) == False
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/3 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of identifying non-prime numbers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `is_not_prime` that takes an integer as an argument.

2. **Handle Edge Cases**: Check for edge cases where numbers less than 2 (like 0 and 1) are not prime. You can return `True` for these cases since they are non-prime.

3. **Check for Primality**: For numbers greater than or equal to 2, check if the number is divisible by any integer from 2 up to the square root of the number. If it is divisible by any of these integers, it is not a prime number.

4. **Return the Result**: If the number is found to be non-prime, return `True`. If it is prime, return `False`.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True  # 0 and 1 are not prime
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True  # Found a divisor, so n is not prime
    return False  # No divisors found, so n is prime
```

With this function, the assertion `assert is_not_prime(2) == False` will pass, as 2 is a prime number.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of identifying non-prime numbers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `is_not_prime` that takes an integer as an argument.

2. **Handle Edge Cases**: Check for edge cases where numbers less than 2 (like 0 and 1) are not prime. You can return `True` for these cases since they are non-prime.

3. **Check for Primality**: For numbers greater than or equal to 2, check if the number is divisible by any integer from 2 up to the square root of the number. If it is divisible by any of these integers, it is not a prime number.

4. **Return the Result**: If the number is found to be non-prime, return `True`. If it is prime, return `False`.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True  # 0 and 1 are not prime
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True  # Found a divisor, so n is not prime
    return False  # No divisors found, so n is prime
```

With this function, the assertion `assert is_not_prime(2) == False` will pass, as 2 is a prime number.
