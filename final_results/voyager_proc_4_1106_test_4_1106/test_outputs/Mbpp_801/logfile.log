"""
Write a python function to count the number of equal numbers from three given integers.
assert test_three_equal(1,1,1) == 3
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/801 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of counting the number of equal integers among three given integers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function named `test_three_equal` that takes three parameters (the three integers).

2. **Initialize a Counter**: Create a variable to keep track of the count of equal numbers. You can initialize it to zero.

3. **Compare the Integers**: Use conditional statements to compare the integers:
   - If all three integers are equal, increment the counter by 3.
   - If two of the integers are equal, increment the counter by 2.
   - If none are equal, the counter remains zero.

4. **Return the Count**: Finally, return the count from the function.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic:

```python
def test_three_equal(a, b, c):
    count = 0
    if a == b == c:
        count = 3
    elif a == b or b == c or a == c:
        count = 2
    return count
```

This function will correctly count the number of equal integers based on the provided assertions.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

Answer: To accomplish the task of counting the number of equal integers among three given integers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:
