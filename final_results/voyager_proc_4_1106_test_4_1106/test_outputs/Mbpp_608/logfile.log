"""
Write a python function to find nth bell number.
assert bell_Number(2) == 2
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/608 [generation text] Answer: To find the nth Bell number in Python, you can use a dynamic programming approach. Bell numbers count the number of ways to partition a set of n elements. The Bell numbers can be computed using a triangular array known as Bell triangle.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of how to accomplish this:

1. **Understanding Bell Numbers**: The Bell number B(n) can be defined recursively. The first Bell number is B(0) = 1. For n > 0, Bell numbers can be computed using the formula:
   - B(n+1) = Î£ (from k=0 to n) C(n, k) * B(k)
   where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: You can create a 2D list (or array) to store the Bell numbers. The first row will start with B(0) = 1.

3. **Filling the Table**: For each subsequent Bell number, you can fill the table using the recursive relationship. You will iterate through the rows and columns of the table to compute the values based on previously computed Bell numbers.

4. **Return the Result**: Once the table is filled up to the nth Bell number, you can simply return the value at the nth index.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic in Python:

```python
def bell_Number(n):
    # Create a 2D list to store Bell numbers
    bell = [[0 for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Base case
    bell[0][0] = 1
    
    # Fill the Bell triangle
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Explicitly put the first value of the current row
        bell[i][0] = bell[i - 1][i - 1]
        
        # Fill the rest of the current row
        for j in range(1, i + 1):
            bell[i][j] = bell[i - 1][j - 1] + bell[i][j - 1]
    
    # The nth Bell number is in bell[n][0]
    return bell[n][0]

# Example usage
assert bell_Number(2) == 2
```

This function constructs the Bell triangle and retrieves the nth Bell number efficiently.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
