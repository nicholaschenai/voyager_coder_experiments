"""
Write a function to remove all whitespaces from the given string.
assert remove_whitespaces(' Google    Flutter ') == 'GoogleFlutter'
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/451 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of removing all whitespaces from a given string in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function named `remove_whitespaces` that takes a single parameter, which will be the input string.

2. **Use String Methods**: Within the function, you can utilize the `replace()` method of the string class. This method allows you to replace all occurrences of a specified substring (in this case, a whitespace character) with another substring (in this case, an empty string).

3. **Return the Result**: After replacing all whitespaces, return the modified string.

4. **Testing the Function**: Use an assertion to test the function with the provided example to ensure it works as expected.

Here is a conceptual outline of the code:

```python
def remove_whitespaces(input_string):
    # Replace all whitespace characters with an empty string
    return input_string.replace(' ', '')

# Test the function
assert remove_whitespaces(' Google    Flutter ') == 'GoogleFlutter'
```

This function will effectively remove all spaces from the input string, and the assertion will confirm that the function behaves as intended.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
