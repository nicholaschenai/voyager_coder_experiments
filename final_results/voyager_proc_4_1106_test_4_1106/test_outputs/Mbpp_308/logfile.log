Write a function to find the specified number of largest products from two given lists, selecting one factor from each list.

"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/308 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the specified number of largest products from two given lists in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Generate Products**: Create a list of products by multiplying each element from the first list with each element from the second list. This can be done using nested loops or a list comprehension.

2. **Sort Products**: Once you have a list of all possible products, sort this list in descending order to prioritize the largest products.

3. **Select Top Products**: After sorting, select the top 'n' products from the sorted list, where 'n' is the specified number of largest products you want to return.

4. **Return Results**: Finally, return the selected products as a list.

Here is a conceptual outline of how the function might look:

```python
def large_product(list1, list2, n):
    # Step 1: Generate all products
    products = [a * b for a in list1 for b in list2]
    
    # Step 2: Sort the products in descending order
    products.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Step 3: Select the top 'n' products
    return products[:n]
```

This function will take two lists and an integer 'n', compute the products, sort them, and return the largest 'n' products as required.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
