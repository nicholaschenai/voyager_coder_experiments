"""
Write a function to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string.
assert find_length("11000010001") == 6
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/125 [generation text] Answer: To solve the problem of finding the maximum difference between the number of 0s and 1s in any substring of a given binary string, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Transform the Problem**: Instead of counting 0s and 1s directly, you can transform the string into a numerical representation where you treat '0' as +1 and '1' as -1. This way, the problem of finding the maximum difference between the counts of 0s and 1s can be reduced to finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in this transformed array.

2. **Use Kadane's Algorithm**: To find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray efficiently, you can use Kadane's algorithm. This algorithm works by iterating through the array while maintaining a running sum of the current subarray. If the running sum becomes negative, you reset it to zero, as starting a new subarray would yield a higher sum.

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum sum found (`max_diff`).
   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the current sum (`current_sum`).
   - Iterate through each character in the binary string:
     - If the character is '0', add 1 to `current_sum`.
     - If the character is '1', subtract 1 from `current_sum`.
     - Update `max_diff` if `current_sum` exceeds it.
     - If `current_sum` drops below zero, reset it to zero.
   
4. **Return the Result**: After iterating through the string, `max_diff` will contain the maximum difference between the number of 0s and 1s in any substring.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def find_length(binary_string):
    max_diff = 0
    current_sum = 0
    
    for char in binary_string:
        if char == '0':
            current_sum += 1
        else:  # char == '1'
            current_sum -= 1
        
        if current_sum > max_diff:
            max_diff = current_sum
        
        if current_sum < 0:
            current_sum = 0
    
    return max_diff
```

This function will correctly compute the maximum difference for the given binary string. In the example provided, `find_length("11000010001")` would return 6, as expected.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
