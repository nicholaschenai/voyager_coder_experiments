Write a python function to find the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius.
assert triangle_area(-1) == None
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/626 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understanding the Geometry**: The largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle is a right triangle. The right angle of this triangle will be at the center of the semicircle, and the other two vertices will lie on the semicircle's circumference.

2. **Area of a Triangle**: The area \( A \) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]
   In the case of the inscribed triangle, the base will be the diameter of the semicircle, and the height will be the radius of the semicircle.

3. **Calculating the Area**: For a semicircle with radius \( r \):
   - The diameter (base) is \( 2r \).
   - The height is \( r \).
   - Therefore, the area of the triangle can be calculated as:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times (2r) \times r = r^2
   \]

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function should handle cases where the radius is negative. In such cases, the function should return `None`.

5. **Function Implementation**: You can implement the function in Python as follows:

```python
def triangle_area(radius):
    if radius < 0:
        return None
    return radius ** 2
```

6. **Assertion**: You can use the provided assertion to test the function:
```python
assert triangle_area(-1) == None
```

This function will correctly compute the area of the largest inscribed triangle for valid radius values and handle negative inputs appropriately.

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

Write a python function to find the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius.

"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understanding the Geometry**: The largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle is a right triangle. The right angle of this triangle will be at the center of the semicircle, and the other two vertices will lie on the semicircle's circumference.

2. **Area of a Triangle**: The area \( A \) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]
   In the case of the inscribed triangle, the base will be the diameter of the semicircle, and the height will be the radius of the semicircle.

3. **Calculating the Area**: For a semicircle with radius \( r \):
   - The diameter (base) is \( 2r \).
   - The height is \( r \).
   - Therefore, the area of the triangle can be calculated as:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times (2r) \times r = r^2
   \]

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function should handle cases where the radius is negative. In such cases, the function should return `None`.

5. **Function Implementation**: You can implement the function in Python as follows:

```python
def triangle_area(radius):
    if radius < 0:
        return None
    return radius ** 2
```

6. **Assertion**: You can use the provided assertion to test the function:
```python
assert triangle_area(-1) == None
```

This function will correctly compute the area of the largest inscribed triangle for valid radius values and handle negative inputs appropriately.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/626 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan for solving the task. The largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle is indeed a right triangle with its hypotenuse as the diameter of the semicircle and the other two sides equal to the radius. The area of such a triangle is calculated as half the product of its base and height, which in this case are the diameter (2r) and the radius (r) respectively. However, there is a small mistake in the calculation of the area in the context. The area should be calculated as \( A = \frac{1}{2} \times (2r) \times r = r^2 \), but the correct formula for the area of a triangle is \( A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \), so the area should be \( A = \frac{1}{2} \times 2r \times r = r^2 \), which simplifies to \( A = r^2 \).

Plan:
1) Define the function `triangle_area` with one parameter `radius`.
2) Check if the `radius` is negative. If it is, return `None`.
3) Calculate the area of the largest inscribed triangle using the formula \( A = \frac{1}{2} \times 2r \times r \).
4) Return the calculated area.

Code:
```python
def triangle_area(radius):
    # Check for negative radius
    if radius < 0:
        return None
    # Calculate the area of the largest inscribed triangle
