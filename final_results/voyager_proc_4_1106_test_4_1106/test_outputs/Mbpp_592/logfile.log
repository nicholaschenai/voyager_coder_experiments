"""
Write a python function to find the sum of the product of consecutive binomial co-efficients.
assert sum_Of_product(3) == 15
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/592 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the sum of the product of consecutive binomial coefficients in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand Binomial Coefficients**: The binomial coefficient, denoted as C(n, k), represents the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements. It can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
   \]
   where `!` denotes factorial.

2. **Generate Binomial Coefficients**: For a given integer `n`, you need to generate the binomial coefficients for all values of `k` from 0 to `n`. This can be done using a loop or a mathematical library that provides a function for calculating binomial coefficients.

3. **Calculate Products of Consecutive Coefficients**: Once you have the list of binomial coefficients, you can iterate through the list and calculate the product of each pair of consecutive coefficients. For example, if you have coefficients `[C(n, 0), C(n, 1), C(n, 2), ..., C(n, n)]`, you would compute the products `C(n, 0) * C(n, 1)`, `C(n, 1) * C(n, 2)`, and so on.

4. **Sum the Products**: Finally, you would sum all the products calculated in the previous step to get the final result.

5. **Return the Result**: The function should return the computed sum.

Here is a conceptual outline of what the function might look like in Python:

```python
from math import comb  # Importing the comb function to calculate binomial coefficients

def sum_Of_product(n):
    total_sum = 0
    # Generate binomial coefficients
    coefficients = [comb(n, k) for k in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Calculate the sum of products of consecutive coefficients
    for i in range(len(coefficients) - 1):
        total_sum += coefficients[i] * coefficients[i + 1]
    
    return total_sum
```

In this function:
- We use `math.comb` to compute the binomial coefficients.
- We create a list of coefficients for the range from 0 to `n`.
- We iterate through the list to calculate the products of consecutive coefficients and sum them up.

This function should satisfy the assertion `assert sum_Of_product(3) == 15`.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the sum of the product of consecutive binomial coefficients in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

5. **Return the Result**: The function should return the computed sum.

Here is a conceptual outline of what the function might look like in Python:

    # Generate binomial coefficients

    for i in range(len(coefficients) - 1):
        total_sum += coefficients[i] * coefficients[i + 1]
    
    return total_sum
```

In this function:
- We use `math.comb` to compute the binomial coefficients.
- We create a list of coefficients for the range from 0 to `n`.
- We iterate through the list to calculate the products of consecutive coefficients and sum them up.

This function should satisfy the assertion `assert sum_Of_product(3) == 15`.

1) Define the function `sum_Of_product` that takes an integer `n` as its argument.
2) Use a loop to iterate over the range from 0 to `n-1` to calculate the product of consecutive binomial coefficients.
3) Use the `calculate_factorial` function provided earlier to calculate the factorial of numbers for the binomial coefficient formula.
4) Calculate the binomial coefficient using the formula `C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)`.
5) Calculate the product of consecutive binomial coefficients and add them to a running total sum.
6) Return the total sum after the loop ends.

    if n == 0:
