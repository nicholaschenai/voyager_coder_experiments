"""
Write a function to find the next smallest palindrome of a specified integer, returned as an integer.
assert next_smallest_palindrome(99)==101
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/100 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the next smallest palindrome of a specified integer in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand Palindromes**: A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards, such as 121 or 1331.

2. **Increment the Input**: Start by incrementing the given integer by 1, since you want the next palindrome that is larger than the input.

3. **Check for Palindrome**: Create a helper function that checks if a number is a palindrome. This can be done by converting the number to a string and comparing it to its reverse.

4. **Loop Until Found**: Use a loop to continuously check each subsequent integer (incrementing by 1 each time) until you find a number that is a palindrome.

5. **Return the Result**: Once you find the next palindrome, return it as the result of the function.

Here is a high-level outline of what the function might look like:

```python
def is_palindrome(n):
    return str(n) == str(n)[::-1]

def next_smallest_palindrome(n):
    n += 1  # Start checking from the next integer
    while not is_palindrome(n):
        n += 1  # Increment until a palindrome is found
    return n
```

In this example, the `is_palindrome` function checks if a number is a palindrome, and the `next_smallest_palindrome` function finds the next palindrome by incrementing the number and checking each one until it finds a match. 

This approach is straightforward and works well for reasonably sized integers.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the next smallest palindrome of a specified integer in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand Palindromes**: A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards, such as 121 or 1331.

2. **Increment the Input**: Start by incrementing the given integer by 1, since you want the next palindrome that is larger than the input.

3. **Check for Palindrome**: Create a helper function that checks if a number is a palindrome. This can be done by converting the number to a string and comparing it to its reverse.

4. **Loop Until Found**: Use a loop to continuously check each subsequent integer (incrementing by 1 each time) until you find a number that is a palindrome.

5. **Return the Result**: Once you find the next palindrome, return it as the result of the function.

Here is a high-level outline of what the function might look like:

```python
def is_palindrome(n):
    return str(n) == str(n)[::-1]

def next_smallest_palindrome(n):
    n += 1  # Start checking from the next integer
    while not is_palindrome(n):
        n += 1  # Increment until a palindrome is found
    return n
```

In this example, the `is_palindrome` function checks if a number is a palindrome, and the `next_smallest_palindrome` function finds the next palindrome by incrementing the number and checking each one until it finds a match. 

This approach is straightforward and works well for reasonably sized integers.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/100 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct approach to solve the task. We need to increment the given integer and check each subsequent number to see if it's a palindrome until we find one.

Plan:
