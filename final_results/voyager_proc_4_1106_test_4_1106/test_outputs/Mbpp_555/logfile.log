"""
Write a python function to find the difference between the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the first n natural numbers.
assert difference(3) == 30
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/555 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the difference between the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the first n natural numbers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `difference` that takes an integer `n` as an argument.

2. **Calculate the Sum of the First n Natural Numbers**: Use the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is \( \text{sum} = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \). Alternatively, you can use a loop or a list comprehension to calculate this sum.

3. **Calculate the Sum of Cubes of the First n Natural Numbers**: The sum of cubes can be calculated using the formula \( \text{sum of cubes} = \left(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\right)^2 \). This is derived from the fact that the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers is the square of the sum of the first n natural numbers.

4. **Compute the Difference**: Subtract the sum of the first n natural numbers from the sum of cubes.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the computed difference.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def difference(n):
    sum_n = n * (n + 1) // 2  # Sum of the first n natural numbers
    sum_cubes = sum_n ** 2     # Sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers
    return sum_cubes - sum_n   # Calculate the difference
```

You can then use the `assert` statement to verify that the function works as expected, for example, `assert difference(3) == 30`. This checks that the function returns the correct difference for the input value of 3.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
