Write a python function to find the first non-repeated character in a given string.

"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/395 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the first non-repeated character in a given string in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Initialize a Data Structure**: Use a dictionary (or a similar data structure) to keep track of the count of each character in the string. This will help you identify which characters are repeated and which are not.

2. **Count Characters**: Iterate through the string and populate the dictionary with the count of each character. For each character, if it exists in the dictionary, increment its count; if it does not exist, add it with a count of 1.

3. **Find the First Non-Repeated Character**: After counting the characters, iterate through the string a second time. For each character, check its count in the dictionary. The first character that has a count of 1 is the first non-repeated character.

4. **Return the Result**: If you find a non-repeated character, return it. If no such character exists (as in the case of the string "abcabc"), return `None`.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def first_non_repeating_character(s):
    char_count = {}
    
    # Count occurrences of each character
    for char in s:
        if char in char_count:
            char_count[char] += 1
        else:
            char_count[char] = 1
            
    # Find the first non-repeated character
    for char in s:
        if char_count[char] == 1:
            return char
            
    return None  # If no non-repeated character is found
```

This function will correctly return the first non-repeated character or `None` if all characters are repeated, as demonstrated by the assertion in your question.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the first non-repeated character in a given string in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Initialize a Data Structure**: Use a dictionary (or a similar data structure) to keep track of the count of each character in the string. This will help you identify which characters are repeated and which are not.

2. **Count Characters**: Iterate through the string and populate the dictionary with the count of each character. For each character, if it exists in the dictionary, increment its count; if it does not exist, add it with a count of 1.

3. **Find the First Non-Repeated Character**: After counting the characters, iterate through the string a second time. For each character, check its count in the dictionary. The first character that has a count of 1 is the first non-repeated character.

4. **Return the Result**: If you find a non-repeated character, return it. If no such character exists (as in the case of the string "abcabc"), return `None`.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def first_non_repeating_character(s):
    char_count = {}
    
    # Count occurrences of each character
    for char in s:
        if char in char_count:
            char_count[char] += 1
        else:
            char_count[char] = 1
            
    # Find the first non-repeated character
    for char in s:
        if char_count[char] == 1:
            return char
            
    return None  # If no non-repeated character is found
```

This function will correctly return the first non-repeated character or `None` if all characters are repeated, as demonstrated by the assertion in your question.
