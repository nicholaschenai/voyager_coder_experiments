[description for function: bfs_traversal]
This function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) traversal on a given graph starting from a specified node, returning the order in which nodes are visited. It initializes a set to keep track of visited nodes and a queue to manage the nodes to be explored. As it processes each node, it adds unvisited neighbors to the queue and marks them as visited. The traversal continues until all reachable nodes have been explored. Finally, it returns a list representing the order of nodes visited during the traversal. This approach ensures that nodes are explored level by level.
