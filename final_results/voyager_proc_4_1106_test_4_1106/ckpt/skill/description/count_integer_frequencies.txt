[description for function: count_integer_frequencies]
This function takes a list of integers as input and counts the frequency of each integer in the list. It initializes an empty dictionary to store the counts. As it iterates through the list, it checks if each integer is already a key in the dictionary; if so, it increments its count, otherwise, it adds the integer as a new key with a count of one. Finally, it returns the dictionary containing the integers and their corresponding frequencies. This allows for easy retrieval of how many times each integer appears in the input list. The function effectively summarizes the occurrences of integers in a given collection.
