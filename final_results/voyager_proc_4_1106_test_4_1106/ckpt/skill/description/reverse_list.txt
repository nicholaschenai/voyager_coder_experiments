[description for function: reverse_list]
This function takes a list as input and reverses its elements in place. It uses two pointers, one starting from the beginning and the other from the end of the list, to swap elements until they meet in the middle. The process continues until all elements have been swapped, effectively reversing the order of the list. The function modifies the original list and returns it after the reversal is complete. It operates with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. The function does not create a new list but alters the existing one directly.
