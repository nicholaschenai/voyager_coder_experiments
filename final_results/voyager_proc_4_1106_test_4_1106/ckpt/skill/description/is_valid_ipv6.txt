[description for function: is_valid_ipv6]
This function checks whether a given string is a valid IPv6 address. It first verifies that the address contains exactly seven colons, indicating the correct number of groups. Then, it splits the address into its constituent groups and checks each group for length and valid hexadecimal characters. Each group must be between 1 and 4 characters long and can only contain digits or letters from 'a' to 'f' (case insensitive). If any group fails these checks, the function returns False; otherwise, it returns True, indicating a valid IPv6 address.
