INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/118 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?

Write a function to convert a string to a list of strings split on the space character.
assert string_to_list("python programming")==['python','programming']
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/118 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of converting a string to a list of strings split on the space character in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function named `string_to_list` that takes a single parameter, which will be the input string.

2. **Use the `split` Method**: Inside the function, utilize the built-in `split()` method of string objects. This method, when called without any arguments, splits the string at each occurrence of whitespace (including spaces, tabs, and newlines) and returns a list of the resulting substrings.

3. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the list generated by the `split()` method.

4. **Testing the Function**: You can use an assertion to test the function by checking if the output of the function matches the expected list.

Here is a conceptual outline of the code:

```python
def string_to_list(input_string):
    return input_string.split()  # Split the string by whitespace and return the list

# Example usage and assertion
assert string_to_list("python programming") == ['python', 'programming']
```

This function will successfully convert the input string into a list of words split by spaces.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/118 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan to accomplish the task. The `split` method without any arguments will indeed split the string at each occurrence of whitespace, which is what is required for this task.

Plan:
1) Define the function `string_to_list` that takes a single argument `input_string`.
2) Inside the function, call the `split` method on `input_string` to split it into a list of strings based on spaces.
3) Return the resulting list.

Code:
```python
def string_to_list(input_string):
    # Split the string by whitespace and return the list
    return input_string.split()

# The assertion will be executed outside this function to test it
```
The assertion provided in the task description will be used to test the function after it is defined:
```python
assert string_to_list("python programming") == ['python', 'programming']
