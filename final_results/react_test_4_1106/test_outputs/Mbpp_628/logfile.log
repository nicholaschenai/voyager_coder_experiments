You are a helpful assistant that answer my question about Python programming.

I will give you the following information:

1) Start your answer with "Answer: ".
2) Answer "Answer: Unknown" if you don't know the answer.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/628 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to replace all spaces in the given string with '%20'.
assert replace_spaces("My Name is Dawood") == 'My%20Name%20is%20Dawood'
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/628 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of replacing all spaces in a given string with '%20', you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function named `replace_spaces` that takes a single string argument.

2. **String Manipulation**: Use a string method to replace spaces. In Python, the `str.replace()` method is a convenient way to replace all occurrences of a substring with another substring.

3. **Return the Result**: After performing the replacement, return the modified string.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def replace_spaces(input_string):
    # Replace all spaces with '%20'
    modified_string = input_string.replace(' ', '%20')
    return modified_string
```

4. **Testing the Function**: You can use an assertion to test if the function works as expected by comparing the output of the function with the expected result.

By following these steps, you can effectively replace spaces in a string with '%20'.

Here are some useful functions written earlier which you can reuse or reference.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/628 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan to accomplish the task. The `str.replace()` method is indeed the appropriate way to replace all occurrences of a substring within a string in Python.

Plan:
1) Define the function `replace_spaces` that takes a single argument `input_string`.
2) Use the `str.replace()` method to replace all spaces (' ') with '%20'.
3) Return the modified string.

```python
