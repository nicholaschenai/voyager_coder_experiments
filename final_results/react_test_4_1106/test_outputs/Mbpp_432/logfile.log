Write a function to find the median length of a trapezium.
assert median_trapezium(15,25,35)==20
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/432 [generation text] Answer: To find the median length of a trapezium (trapezoid), you can use the formula for the median, which is the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides (bases) of the trapezium. In this case, the bases are represented by the first two parameters of the function.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of how to accomplish this task in Python:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `median_trapezium` that takes three parameters: the lengths of the two bases and the height (though the height is not needed for calculating the median).

2. **Calculate the Median**: Inside the function, calculate the median length using the formula:
   \[
   \text{median} = \frac{(b_1 + b_2)}{2}
   \]
   where \(b_1\) and \(b_2\) are the lengths of the two bases.

3. **Return the Result**: Return the calculated median length.

4. **Assertion**: Use the `assert` statement to check if the function returns the expected value for the given inputs.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def median_trapezium(base1, base2, height):
    return (base1 + base2) / 2

# Example assertion
assert median_trapezium(15, 25, 35) == 20
```

In this implementation, the function correctly calculates the median length of the trapezium based on the provided bases. The height parameter is included in the function signature but is not used in the calculation, as it is not necessary for finding the median length.

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To find the median length of a trapezium (trapezoid), you can use the formula for the median, which is the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides (bases) of the trapezium. In this case, the bases are represented by the first two parameters of the function.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of how to accomplish this task in Python:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `median_trapezium` that takes three parameters: the lengths of the two bases and the height (though the height is not needed for calculating the median).

2. **Calculate the Median**: Inside the function, calculate the median length using the formula:
   \[
   \text{median} = \frac{(b_1 + b_2)}{2}
   \]
   where \(b_1\) and \(b_2\) are the lengths of the two bases.

3. **Return the Result**: Return the calculated median length.

4. **Assertion**: Use the `assert` statement to check if the function returns the expected value for the given inputs.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def median_trapezium(base1, base2, height):
    return (base1 + base2) / 2

# Example assertion
assert median_trapezium(15, 25, 35) == 20
```

In this implementation, the function correctly calculates the median length of the trapezium based on the provided bases. The height parameter is included in the function signature but is not used in the calculation, as it is not necessary for finding the median length.

You are a Python programming assistant that assesses my progress of Python programming and provides useful guidance.

[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)
