"""
Write a function to find the nth number in the newman conway sequence.
assert sequence(10) == 6
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/84 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the nth number in the Newman-Conway sequence in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand the Newman-Conway Sequence**: The sequence is defined as follows:
   - For n = 1, the value is 1.
   - For n = 2, the value is 1.
   - For n > 2, the value is given by the formula: `P(n) = P(P(n-1)) + P(n-P(n-1))`, where P(n) is the nth number in the sequence.

2. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `sequence` that takes an integer `n` as an argument.

3. **Handle Base Cases**: Inside the function, handle the base cases for n = 1 and n = 2 by returning 1.

4. **Use a List for Memoization**: To efficiently compute the values for larger n, use a list to store previously computed values of the sequence. This avoids redundant calculations.

5. **Iterate to Compute Values**: Use a loop to compute the values of the sequence from 3 up to n using the defined formula, storing each result in the list.

6. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the nth value from the list.

Here is a conceptual outline of the code:

```python
def sequence(n):
    if n == 1 or n == 2:
        return 1
    # Create a list to store the sequence values
    P = [0] * (n + 1)
    P[1], P[2] = 1, 1  # Base cases

    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        P[i] = P[P[i - 1]] + P[i - P[i - 1]]

    return P[n]

# Example usage
assert sequence(10) == 6
```

This function will correctly compute the nth number in the Newman-Conway sequence based on the defined rules.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the nth number in the Newman-Conway sequence in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand the Newman-Conway Sequence**: The sequence is defined as follows:
   - For n = 1, the value is 1.
   - For n = 2, the value is 1.
   - For n > 2, the value is given by the formula: `P(n) = P(P(n-1)) + P(n-P(n-1))`, where P(n) is the nth number in the sequence.

2. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `sequence` that takes an integer `n` as an argument.

3. **Handle Base Cases**: Inside the function, handle the base cases for n = 1 and n = 2 by returning 1.

4. **Use a List for Memoization**: To efficiently compute the values for larger n, use a list to store previously computed values of the sequence. This avoids redundant calculations.

5. **Iterate to Compute Values**: Use a loop to compute the values of the sequence from 3 up to n using the defined formula, storing each result in the list.

6. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the nth value from the list.

Here is a conceptual outline of the code:

```python
def sequence(n):
    if n == 1 or n == 2:
        return 1
    # Create a list to store the sequence values
    P = [0] * (n + 1)
    P[1], P[2] = 1, 1  # Base cases

    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        P[i] = P[P[i - 1]] + P[i - P[i - 1]]

    return P[n]

# Example usage

This function will correctly compute the nth number in the Newman-Conway sequence based on the defined rules.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/84 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan to implement the function to find the nth number in the Newman-Conway sequence. The steps outlined are appropriate for the task at hand.

Plan:
1) Define the function `sequence` that takes an integer `n` as an argument.
2) Handle the base cases for `n = 1` and `n = 2` by returning 1.
3) Initialize a list `P` with a size of `n + 1` to store the sequence values. Set the first two values to 1, as per the base cases.
4) Use a loop to compute the values of the sequence from 3 up to `n` using the formula `P(n) = P(P(n-1)) + P(n-P(n-1))`.
5) Store each computed value in the list `P`.
6) Return the nth value from the list `P`.

Code:
```python
def sequence(n):
