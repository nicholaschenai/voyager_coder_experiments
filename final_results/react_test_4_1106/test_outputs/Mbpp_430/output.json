    "reasoning": "The implementation failed the test case because it incorrectly calculates the vertex 'k' and the directrix. The formula for 'k' should be a * h^2 + b * h + c, but the implementation uses c - (b^2 / (4 * a)) which is incorrect. Additionally, the directrix calculation does not account for the orientation of the parabola (upward or downward).",
    "success": false,
    "critique": "To correct the implementation, use the correct formula for 'k': k = a * h^2 + b * h + c. Also, ensure that the directrix calculation accounts for the orientation of the parabola. If 'a' is positive, the parabola opens upwards and the directrix should be k - (1 / (4 * a)). If 'a' is negative, the parabola opens downwards and the directrix should be k + (1 / (4 * a))."
