"""
Write a function to find the directrix of a parabola.
assert parabola_directrix(5,3,2)==-198
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/430 [generation text] Answer: To find the directrix of a parabola given its standard form, we need to understand the parameters involved. A parabola can be represented in the form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) or in vertex form \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \), where \((h, k)\) is the vertex of the parabola.

The directrix of a parabola is a line that is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry and is located at a distance from the vertex that is equal to the distance from the vertex to the focus. For a parabola that opens upwards or downwards, the directrix can be calculated using the formula:

- If the parabola opens upwards, the directrix is given by \( y = k - \frac{1}{4p} \), where \( p \) is the distance from the vertex to the focus.
- If the parabola opens downwards, the directrix is given by \( y = k + \frac{1}{4p} \).

In your case, the function `parabola_directrix(a, b, c)` likely needs to calculate the vertex of the parabola first, then determine the value of \( p \) based on the coefficient \( a \), and finally compute the directrix.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual outline of the function:

1. **Calculate the vertex**: The vertex \((h, k)\) can be found using the formulas:
   - \( h = -\frac{b}{2a} \)
   - \( k = f(h) = a(h^2) + b(h) + c \)

2. **Determine the value of \( p \)**: For a parabola in the form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), \( p \) can be calculated as \( p = \frac{1}{4a} \).

3. **Calculate the directrix**: Depending on the orientation of the parabola (upward or downward), use the appropriate formula for the directrix.

4. **Return the directrix value**.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic:

```python
def parabola_directrix(a, b, c):
    # Step 1: Calculate the vertex
    h = -b / (2 * a)
    k = a * (h ** 2) + b * h + c
    
    # Step 2: Calculate p
    p = 1 / (4 * a)
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the directrix
    directrix = k - p  # For upward opening parabola
    
    return directrix

# Example usage
assert parabola_directrix(5, 3, 2) == -198
```

This function should correctly compute the directrix for the given parameters. Adjust the directrix calculation if the parabola opens downwards or if the formula needs to be modified based on specific requirements.

The directrix of a parabola is a line that is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry and is located at a distance from the vertex that is equal to the distance from the vertex to the focus. For a parabola that opens upwards or downwards, the directrix can be calculated using the formula:

- If the parabola opens upwards, the directrix is given by \( y = k - \frac{1}{4p} \), where \( p \) is the distance from the vertex to the focus.
- If the parabola opens downwards, the directrix is given by \( y = k + \frac{1}{4p} \).

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/430 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a general idea of how to find the directrix of a parabola, but it does not account for the fact that the directrix equation provided is incorrect. The directrix of a parabola given by the equation \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) is not dependent on the vertex form of the equation. Instead, it is related to the focal length \( p \), which is the distance from the vertex to the focus of the parabola. The correct formula for the directrix of a parabola that opens upwards is \( y = k - p \), and for a parabola that opens downwards, it is \( y = k + p \), where \( p = \frac{1}{4a} \) if \( a > 0 \) (upward opening) and \( p = -\frac{1}{4a} \) if \( a < 0 \) (downward opening).

Plan:
1) Calculate the vertex \( h \) using the formula \( h = -\frac{b}{2a} \).
2) Calculate the focal length \( p \) using the formula \( p = \frac{1}{4|a|} \), where \( |a| \) is the absolute value of \( a \).
3) Determine if the parabola opens upwards or downwards by checking the sign of \( a \).
4) Calculate the directrix using the formula \( y = k - p \) if the parabola opens upwards, or \( y = k + p \) if it opens downwards.
5) Since the task does not specify the need to calculate \( k \), and the directrix for a parabola in standard form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) does not depend on \( k \), we can simplify the calculation of the directrix to \( y = -\frac{1}{4a} \) for an upward opening parabola and \( y = \frac{1}{4a} \) for a downward opening parabola.

[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

"""
Write a function to find the directrix of a parabola.
assert parabola_directrix(5,3,2)==-198
"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To find the directrix of a parabola given its standard form, we need to understand the parameters involved. A parabola can be represented in the form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) or in vertex form \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \), where \((h, k)\) is the vertex of the parabola.

The directrix of a parabola is a line that is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry and is located at a distance from the vertex that is equal to the distance from the vertex to the focus. For a parabola that opens upwards or downwards, the directrix can be calculated using the formula:

- If the parabola opens upwards, the directrix is given by \( y = k - \frac{1}{4p} \), where \( p \) is the distance from the vertex to the focus.
- If the parabola opens downwards, the directrix is given by \( y = k + \frac{1}{4p} \).

In your case, the function `parabola_directrix(a, b, c)` likely needs to calculate the vertex of the parabola first, then determine the value of \( p \) based on the coefficient \( a \), and finally compute the directrix.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual outline of the function:

1. **Calculate the vertex**: The vertex \((h, k)\) can be found using the formulas:
   - \( h = -\frac{b}{2a} \)
   - \( k = f(h) = a(h^2) + b(h) + c \)

2. **Determine the value of \( p \)**: For a parabola in the form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), \( p \) can be calculated as \( p = \frac{1}{4a} \).

3. **Calculate the directrix**: Depending on the orientation of the parabola (upward or downward), use the appropriate formula for the directrix.

4. **Return the directrix value**.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic:

```python
def parabola_directrix(a, b, c):
    # Step 1: Calculate the vertex
    h = -b / (2 * a)
    k = a * (h ** 2) + b * h + c
    
    # Step 2: Calculate p
    p = 1 / (4 * a)
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the directrix
    directrix = k - p  # For upward opening parabola
    
    return directrix

# Example usage
assert parabola_directrix(5, 3, 2) == -198
```

This function should correctly compute the directrix for the given parameters. Adjust the directrix calculation if the parabola opens downwards or if the formula needs to be modified based on specific requirements.


[Critique]
To fix the implementation, the function needs to first calculate the vertex (h, k) of the parabola using the formulas h = -b / (2 * a) and k = a * h^2 + b * h + c. Then, it should use the value of 'p' to calculate the directrix based on the orientation of the parabola. If the parabola opens upwards (a > 0), the directrix is k - (1 / (4 * a)). If it opens downwards (a < 0), the directrix is k + (1 / (4 * a)).


INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/430 [generation text] Explain: The previous implementation of the function `parabola_directrix` incorrectly calculated the directrix. It only considered the value of `p` and the sign of `a` to determine the directrix, but it did not calculate the vertex `(h, k)` of the parabola, which is necessary to find the correct directrix. Additionally, the formula used to calculate the directrix was incorrect.

Plan:
1) Calculate the vertex `(h, k)` of the parabola using the formulas `h = -b / (2 * a)` and `k = c - (b^2 / (4 * a))`.
2) Determine the value of `p` using the formula `p = 1 / (4 * a)`.
3) Calculate the directrix. If the parabola opens upwards (a > 0), the directrix is `k - p`. If it opens downwards (a < 0), the directrix is `k + p`.
4) Return the directrix value.

Code:
```python
def parabola_directrix(a, b, c):
    # Step 1: Calculate the vertex (h, k)

It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

This function should correctly compute the directrix for the given parameters. Adjust the directrix calculation if the parabola opens downwards or if the formula needs to be modified based on specific requirements.


[Critique]
To correct the implementation, use the proper formula for 'k': k = a * h^2 + b * h + c. Also, ensure that the function returns the equation of the directrix line. For an upward opening parabola, the directrix is y = k - p, and for a downward opening parabola, it is y = k + p. The function should return the y-value of the directrix line, not just a single point.


INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/430 [generation text] Explain: The previous implementation of the function `parabola_directrix` incorrectly calculated the vertex 'k' and did not correctly apply the formula for the directrix. The correct formula for 'k' is \( k = c - \frac{b^2}{4a} \), and the directrix is \( y = k - \frac{1}{4a} \) for an upward opening parabola and \( y = k + \frac{1}{4a} \) for a downward opening parabola. However, the assertion provided in the task seems incorrect because the expected value of -198 does not match the calculation for the given coefficients of the parabola. We will need to correct the formula and recalculate the expected value for the directrix.

Plan:
1) Calculate the vertex 'h' using the formula \( h = -\frac{b}{2a} \).
2) Calculate the vertex 'k' using the formula \( k = c - \frac{b^2}{4a} \).
3) Determine the value of 'p' using the formula \( p = \frac{1}{4a} \).
4) Calculate the directrix using the formula \( y = k - p \) for an upward opening parabola (since 'a' is positive in the assertion).
5) Return the y-value of the directrix.

Code:
```python
def parabola_directrix(a, b, c):
    # Step 1: Calculate the vertex 'h'
    h = -b / (2 * a)
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the vertex 'k'
    k = c - (b ** 2) / (4 * a)
    
    # Step 3: Determine the value of 'p'
    p = 1 / (4 * a)
    
    # Step 4: Calculate the directrix for an upward opening parabola
    directrix = k - p
    
    return directrix

# The assertion provided in the task seems incorrect, so we will not use it here.
# Instead, we will calculate the expected value based on the given coefficients.
```

Note: Since the assertion provided in the task seems incorrect, I have not included it in the code. The function will calculate the directrix based on the given coefficients, and the correct value can be verified by manual calculation or by using the function with known inputs and expected outputs.

 Explain: The previous implementation of the function `parabola_directrix` incorrectly calculated the vertex 'k' and did not correctly apply the formula for the directrix. The correct formula for 'k' is \( k = c - \frac{b^2}{4a} \), and the directrix is \( y = k - \frac{1}{4a} \) for an upward opening parabola and \( y = k + \frac{1}{4a} \) for a downward opening parabola. However, the assertion provided in the task seems incorrect because the expected value of -198 does not match the calculation for the given coefficients of the parabola. We will need to correct the formula and recalculate the expected value for the directrix.

Plan:
1) Calculate the vertex 'h' using the formula \( h = -\frac{b}{2a} \).
2) Calculate the vertex 'k' using the formula \( k = c - \frac{b^2}{4a} \).
3) Determine the value of 'p' using the formula \( p = \frac{1}{4a} \).
4) Calculate the directrix using the formula \( y = k - p \) for an upward opening parabola (since 'a' is positive in the assertion).
5) Return the y-value of the directrix.

Code:
```python
def parabola_directrix(a, b, c):
    # Step 1: Calculate the vertex 'h'
    h = -b / (2 * a)
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the vertex 'k'
    k = c - (b ** 2) / (4 * a)
    
    # Step 3: Determine the value of 'p'
    p = 1 / (4 * a)
    
    # Step 4: Calculate the directrix for an upward opening parabola
    directrix = k - p
    
    return directrix

# The assertion provided in the task seems incorrect, so we will not use it here.
# Instead, we will calculate the expected value based on the given coefficients.
```

Note: Since the assertion provided in the task seems incorrect, I have not included it in the code. The function will calculate the directrix based on the given coefficients, and the correct value can be verified by manual calculation or by using the function with known inputs and expected outputs.

"""
Write a function to find the directrix of a parabola.
assert parabola_directrix(5,3,2)==-198
"""

[Context]: 
 Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To find the directrix of a parabola given its standard form, we need to understand the parameters involved. A parabola can be represented in the form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) or in vertex form \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \), where \((h, k)\) is the vertex of the parabola.

The directrix of a parabola is a line that is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry and is located at a distance from the vertex that is equal to the distance from the vertex to the focus. For a parabola that opens upwards or downwards, the directrix can be calculated using the formula:

- If the parabola opens upwards, the directrix is given by \( y = k - \frac{1}{4p} \), where \( p \) is the distance from the vertex to the focus.
- If the parabola opens downwards, the directrix is given by \( y = k + \frac{1}{4p} \).

In your case, the function `parabola_directrix(a, b, c)` likely needs to calculate the vertex of the parabola first, then determine the value of \( p \) based on the coefficient \( a \), and finally compute the directrix.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual outline of the function:

1. **Calculate the vertex**: The vertex \((h, k)\) can be found using the formulas:
   - \( h = -\frac{b}{2a} \)
   - \( k = f(h) = a(h^2) + b(h) + c \)

2. **Determine the value of \( p \)**: For a parabola in the form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), \( p \) can be calculated as \( p = \frac{1}{4a} \).

3. **Calculate the directrix**: Depending on the orientation of the parabola (upward or downward), use the appropriate formula for the directrix.

4. **Return the directrix value**.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic:

```python
def parabola_directrix(a, b, c):
    # Step 1: Calculate the vertex
    h = -b / (2 * a)
    k = a * (h ** 2) + b * h + c
    
    # Step 2: Calculate p
    p = 1 / (4 * a)
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the directrix
    directrix = k - p  # For upward opening parabola
    
    return directrix

# Example usage
assert parabola_directrix(5, 3, 2) == -198
```

This function should correctly compute the directrix for the given parameters. Adjust the directrix calculation if the parabola opens downwards or if the formula needs to be modified based on specific requirements.


[function impl]:


def parabola_directrix(a, b, c):
    h = ((- b) / (2 * a))
    k = (c - ((b ** 2) / (4 * a)))
    p = (1 / (4 * a))
    directrix = (k - p)
    return directrix

To correct the implementation, the formula for 'k' should be changed to k = a * h^2 + b * h + c, which is the correct way to evaluate the y-coordinate of the vertex using the vertex's x-coordinate 'h'.

To overcome this error, we should change the condition to only update the result when the current subarray length is strictly greater than the previous longest subarray length.

This results in a runtime error when right goes beyond the list length. To overcome this error, we need to add a bounds check for the right variable in the mentioned while loop. We can modify the loop condition to while right < len(nums) and current_sum + nums[right] <= target:. This change will ensure that we only access elements within the bounds of the list, thus avoiding the IndexError."

"""
Write a function to find the directrix of a parabola.
assert parabola_directrix(5,3,2)==-198
"""

[Context]: 
 Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To find the directrix of a parabola given its standard form, we need to understand the parameters involved. A parabola can be represented in the form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) or in vertex form \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \), where \((h, k)\) is the vertex of the parabola.

The directrix of a parabola is a line that is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry and is located at a distance from the vertex that is equal to the distance from the vertex to the focus. For a parabola that opens upwards or downwards, the directrix can be calculated using the formula:

- If the parabola opens upwards, the directrix is given by \( y = k - \frac{1}{4p} \), where \( p \) is the distance from the vertex to the focus.
- If the parabola opens downwards, the directrix is given by \( y = k + \frac{1}{4p} \).

In your case, the function `parabola_directrix(a, b, c)` likely needs to calculate the vertex of the parabola first, then determine the value of \( p \) based on the coefficient \( a \), and finally compute the directrix.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual outline of the function:

1. **Calculate the vertex**: The vertex \((h, k)\) can be found using the formulas:
   - \( h = -\frac{b}{2a} \)
   - \( k = f(h) = a(h^2) + b(h) + c \)

2. **Determine the value of \( p \)**: For a parabola in the form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), \( p \) can be calculated as \( p = \frac{1}{4a} \).

3. **Calculate the directrix**: Depending on the orientation of the parabola (upward or downward), use the appropriate formula for the directrix.

4. **Return the directrix value**.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic:

```python
def parabola_directrix(a, b, c):
    # Step 1: Calculate the vertex
    h = -b / (2 * a)
    k = a * (h ** 2) + b * h + c
    
    # Step 2: Calculate p
    p = 1 / (4 * a)
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the directrix
    directrix = k - p  # For upward opening parabola
    
    return directrix

# Example usage
assert parabola_directrix(5, 3, 2) == -198
```

This function should correctly compute the directrix for the given parameters. Adjust the directrix calculation if the parabola opens downwards or if the formula needs to be modified based on specific requirements.


[function impl]:


def parabola_directrix(a, b, c):
    h = ((- b) / (2 * a))
    k = (c - ((b ** 2) / (4 * a)))
    directrix = (k - (1 / (4 * a)))
    return directrix
