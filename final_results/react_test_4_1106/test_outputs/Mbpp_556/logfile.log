"""
Write a python function to count the number of pairs whose xor value is odd.
assert find_Odd_Pair([5,4,7,2,1],5) == 6
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/556 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of counting the number of pairs whose XOR value is odd, we need to understand a few key concepts about XOR and the properties of odd and even numbers.

1. **XOR Operation**: The XOR (exclusive or) operation between two bits results in 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same. For two integers, the XOR operation is performed bit by bit.

2. **Odd and Even Numbers**: An integer is odd if it is not divisible by 2 (i.e., it has a remainder of 1 when divided by 2), and even if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., it has a remainder of 0). The XOR of two integers is odd if one of them is odd and the other is even.

3. **Counting Pairs**: To find the number of pairs whose XOR is odd, we can iterate through the list of numbers and count how many are odd and how many are even. The number of valid pairs can then be calculated as the product of the count of odd numbers and the count of even numbers.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual outline of the function:

- Initialize two counters: one for odd numbers and one for even numbers.
- Loop through the list of numbers:
  - For each number, check if it is odd or even and increment the respective counter.
- The result will be the product of the count of odd numbers and the count of even numbers, as each odd number can form a pair with each even number.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic in Python:

```python
def find_Odd_Pair(arr, n):
    odd_count = 0
    even_count = 0
    
    for num in arr:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            even_count += 1
        else:
            odd_count += 1
            
    return odd_count * even_count

# Example usage
assert find_Odd_Pair([5, 4, 7, 2, 1], 5) == 6
```

In this implementation:
- We loop through the input list `arr` to count the odd and even numbers.
- Finally, we return the product of the counts, which gives us the number of pairs whose XOR is odd.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/556 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct explanation of how to solve the task. The XOR of two numbers is odd if and only if one of them is odd and the other is even. Therefore, the number of pairs with an odd XOR is the product of the number of odd and even numbers in the list.

Plan:
1) Define the function `find_Odd_Pair` that takes a list `arr` and an integer `n` as arguments.
2) Initialize two counters, `odd_count` and `even_count`, to zero.
3) Iterate over each number in the list `arr`.
4) For each number, check if it is odd or even by using the modulo operator `%`.
5) Increment `odd_count` if the number is odd, otherwise increment `even_count`.
6) After the loop, return the product of `odd_count` and `even_count` as the result.

Code:
```python
def find_Odd_Pair(arr, n):
    odd_count = 0
    even_count = 0
    
    for num in arr:
        if num % 2 == 0:
