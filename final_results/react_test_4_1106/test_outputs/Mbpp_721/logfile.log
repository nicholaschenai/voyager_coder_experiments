"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/721 [generation text] Answer: To solve the problem of finding the path with the maximum average cost in a square matrix, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of how to accomplish this task:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find a path from the top-left corner of the matrix to the bottom-right corner, moving only right or down. The goal is to maximize the average cost of the cells visited along this path.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We can create a 2D list (or table) `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will store the maximum total cost to reach cell `(i, j)` and the number of cells visited to reach that cell.

3. **Initialization**: Start by initializing `dp[0][0]` with the cost of the top-left cell and set the number of cells visited to 1.

4. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - Iterate through each cell in the matrix.
   - For each cell `(i, j)`, check the cells from which it can be reached: `(i-1, j)` (from above) and `(i, j-1)` (from the left).
   - Update `dp[i][j]` by considering the maximum total cost from the reachable cells and incrementing the count of cells visited.

5. **Calculating the Maximum Average**: Once the DP table is filled, the maximum average can be calculated by iterating through the last cell `(N-1, N-1)` and using the formula:
   \[
   \text{average} = \frac{\text{total cost}}{\text{number of cells visited}}
   \]
   This will give the maximum average for the path from the top-left to the bottom-right corner.

6. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the maximum average found.

Hereâ€™s a high-level pseudocode representation of the above steps:

```python
def maxAverageOfPath(matrix):
    N = len(matrix)
    dp = [[(0, 0) for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]  # (total_cost, count)

    dp[0][0] = (matrix[0][0], 1)  # Initialize the starting point

    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if i == 0 and j == 0:
                continue  # Skip the starting cell
            max_cost, count = 0, 0
            if i > 0:  # From above
                max_cost, count = dp[i-1][j]
            if j > 0:  # From left
                left_cost, left_count = dp[i][j-1]
                if left_cost > max_cost:  # Choose the better path
                    max_cost, count = left_cost, left_count
            
            dp[i][j] = (max_cost + matrix[i][j], count + 1)

    total_cost, count = dp[N-1][N-1]
    return total_cost / count  # Calculate the average
```

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum average path cost while adhering to the movement constraints.

    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.

    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests

However, the plan has a critical flaw: it only considers the maximum total cost from the reachable cells, but it does not account for the fact that we need to maximize the average cost, not the total cost. To maximize the average, we need to consider both the total cost and the number of cells visited. We should compare the average cost of the paths leading to each cell, not just the total cost.

Plan:
1) Define the function `maxAverageOfPath(matrix)` that takes a square matrix as input.
2) Initialize a 2D list `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will store a tuple `(total_cost, count)` representing the maximum total cost to reach cell `(i, j)` and the number of cells visited to reach that cell.

6) Update `dp[i][j]` with the maximum average cost and the corresponding total cost and count of cells visited.
7) After filling the DP table, calculate the average for the last cell `(N-1, N-1)` using the total cost and the number of cells visited.
