"""
Write a function to calculate a dog's age in dog's years.
assert dog_age(12)==61
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/264 [generation text] Answer: To calculate a dog's age in dog's years, you can follow a conceptual approach that involves understanding the common conversion between human years and dog years. 

Typically, the first two years of a dog's life are considered to be equivalent to 10.5 human years each, and each subsequent year is equivalent to about 4 human years. 

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step outline of how you can implement this in a function:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `dog_age` that takes one parameter, which represents the dog's age in human years.

2. **Implement the Conversion Logic**:
   - If the dog's age is less than or equal to 2, multiply the age by 10.5.
   - If the dog's age is greater than 2, calculate the age for the first two years (10.5 * 2) and then add 4 times the number of years beyond 2.

3. **Return the Result**: The function should return the calculated dog's age in dog years.

4. **Testing the Function**: Use the `assert` statement to verify that the function works as expected, for example, `assert dog_age(12) == 61`.

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of the above logic:

```python
def dog_age(human_years):
    if human_years <= 2:
        return human_years * 10.5
    else:
        return 21 + (human_years - 2) * 4

# Example usage
assert dog_age(12) == 61
```

This function will correctly calculate the dog's age in dog years based on the provided human years.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To calculate a dog's age in dog's years, you can follow a conceptual approach that involves understanding the common conversion between human years and dog years. 

Typically, the first two years of a dog's life are considered to be equivalent to 10.5 human years each, and each subsequent year is equivalent to about 4 human years. 

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step outline of how you can implement this in a function:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `dog_age` that takes one parameter, which represents the dog's age in human years.

2. **Implement the Conversion Logic**:
   - If the dog's age is less than or equal to 2, multiply the age by 10.5.
   - If the dog's age is greater than 2, calculate the age for the first two years (10.5 * 2) and then add 4 times the number of years beyond 2.

3. **Return the Result**: The function should return the calculated dog's age in dog years.

4. **Testing the Function**: Use the `assert` statement to verify that the function works as expected, for example, `assert dog_age(12) == 61`.

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of the above logic:

```python
def dog_age(human_years):
    if human_years <= 2:
        return human_years * 10.5
    else:
        return 21 + (human_years - 2) * 4

# Example usage
assert dog_age(12) == 61
```

This function will correctly calculate the dog's age in dog years based on the provided human years.
