    "reasoning": "The implementation failed the test case because it incorrectly counts the total number of sequences. The error is in the loop where it adds the count for sequences of length n-1 without considering the constraint that each element must be at least twice the previous element.",
    "success": false,
    "critique": "To fix the implementation, the recursive call should pass the next valid starting point as the new maximum value 'm' for the subsequence. This means updating the recursive call to get_total_number_of_sequences(2 * x, n - 1, memo) instead of get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n - 1, memo). Additionally, the loop should start at x = 1 and go up to m inclusive, and the condition for the loop should be updated to ensure x is less than or equal to m divided by 2 to the power of (n - 1)."
