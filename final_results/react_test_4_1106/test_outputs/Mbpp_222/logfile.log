INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/222 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to check if all the elements in tuple have same data type or not.
assert check_type((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6) ) == True
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/222 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of checking if all elements in a tuple have the same data type in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `check_type` that takes a tuple as an argument.

2. **Extract the Data Type**: Use the `type()` function to get the data type of the first element in the tuple. This will serve as a reference for comparison.

3. **Iterate Through the Tuple**: Use a loop (like a `for` loop) to iterate through each element in the tuple.

4. **Compare Data Types**: For each element, check if its data type (obtained using `type()`) matches the reference data type obtained from the first element.

5. **Return the Result**: If all elements match the reference type, return `True`. If any element does not match, return `False`.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def check_type(tup):
    if not tup:  # Check if the tuple is empty
        return True  # An empty tuple can be considered as having the same type
    first_type = type(tup[0])  # Get the type of the first element
    for element in tup:
        if type(element) != first_type:  # Compare types
            return False  # Return False if a mismatch is found
    return True  # Return True if all types match
```

This function will correctly assert that all elements in the tuple have the same data type.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

Write a function to check if all the elements in tuple have same data type or not.

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of checking if all elements in a tuple have the same data type in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `check_type` that takes a tuple as an argument.

2. **Extract the Data Type**: Use the `type()` function to get the data type of the first element in the tuple. This will serve as a reference for comparison.

3. **Iterate Through the Tuple**: Use a loop (like a `for` loop) to iterate through each element in the tuple.

4. **Compare Data Types**: For each element, check if its data type (obtained using `type()`) matches the reference data type obtained from the first element.

5. **Return the Result**: If all elements match the reference type, return `True`. If any element does not match, return `False`.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def check_type(tup):
    if not tup:  # Check if the tuple is empty
        return True  # An empty tuple can be considered as having the same type
    first_type = type(tup[0])  # Get the type of the first element
    for element in tup:
        if type(element) != first_type:  # Compare types
            return False  # Return False if a mismatch is found
    return True  # Return True if all types match
```

This function will correctly assert that all elements in the tuple have the same data type.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/222 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan for implementing the function. It outlines the steps needed to check if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. The provided code snippet is also correct and should work as expected.

Plan:
1) Define the function `check_type` that takes a single argument, which is a tuple.
2) Check if the tuple is empty and return `True` if it is, as an empty tuple can be considered to have the same data type for all elements (since there are no elements).
3) Store the data type of the first element of the tuple for reference.
4) Iterate over each element in the tuple and compare its data type with the reference data type.
5) If any element has a different data type, return `False`.
6) If all elements have the same data type, return `True` after the loop completes.

Code:
```python
def check_type(tup):
    # Check if the tuple is empty
    if not tup:
        return True  # An empty tuple is considered to have the same type
    
    # Get the type of the first element
    first_type = type(tup[0])
    
    # Compare types of all elements with the first element's type
    for element in tup:
        if type(element) != first_type:
            return False  # Return False if a mismatch is found
    
    # Return True if all types match
