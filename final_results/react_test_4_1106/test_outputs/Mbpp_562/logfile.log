"""
Write a python function to find the length of the longest sublists.
assert Find_Max_Length([[1],[1,4],[5,6,7,8]]) == 4
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/562 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the length of the longest sublist in a list of lists in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `Find_Max_Length` that takes a single argument, which is a list of lists.

2. **Initialize a Variable**: Inside the function, initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum length found. You can start it at zero.

3. **Iterate Through Sublists**: Use a loop to iterate through each sublist in the main list.

4. **Calculate Length**: For each sublist, calculate its length using the built-in `len()` function.

5. **Update Maximum Length**: Compare the length of the current sublist with the maximum length variable. If the current sublist's length is greater, update the maximum length variable.

6. **Return the Result**: After checking all sublists, return the maximum length found.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def Find_Max_Length(sublists):
    max_length = 0
    for sublist in sublists:
        current_length = len(sublist)
        if current_length > max_length:
            max_length = current_length
    return max_length

# Example usage
assert Find_Max_Length([[1], [1, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]]) == 4
```

This function will correctly find the length of the longest sublist in the provided list of lists.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

Write a python function to find the length of the longest sublists.

"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the length of the longest sublist in a list of lists in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `Find_Max_Length` that takes a single argument, which is a list of lists.

2. **Initialize a Variable**: Inside the function, initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum length found. You can start it at zero.

3. **Iterate Through Sublists**: Use a loop to iterate through each sublist in the main list.

4. **Calculate Length**: For each sublist, calculate its length using the built-in `len()` function.

5. **Update Maximum Length**: Compare the length of the current sublist with the maximum length variable. If the current sublist's length is greater, update the maximum length variable.

6. **Return the Result**: After checking all sublists, return the maximum length found.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def Find_Max_Length(sublists):
    max_length = 0
    for sublist in sublists:
        current_length = len(sublist)
        if current_length > max_length:
            max_length = current_length
    return max_length

# Example usage
assert Find_Max_Length([[1], [1, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]]) == 4
```

This function will correctly find the length of the longest sublist in the provided list of lists.
