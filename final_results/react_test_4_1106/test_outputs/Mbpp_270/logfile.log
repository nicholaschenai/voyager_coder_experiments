INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/270 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a python function to find the sum of even numbers at even positions of a list.
assert sum_even_and_even_index([5, 6, 12, 1, 18, 8]) == 30
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/270 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the sum of even numbers at even positions in a list, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a list as an argument.

2. **Initialize a Sum Variable**: Create a variable to keep track of the sum of the even numbers found at even indices.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to go through the list. You can use the `enumerate` function to get both the index and the value of each element in the list.

4. **Check Conditions**: For each element, check if the index is even (you can do this by checking if the index modulo 2 is zero) and if the value is even (again, check if the value modulo 2 is zero).

5. **Update the Sum**: If both conditions are met, add the value to the sum variable.

6. **Return the Result**: After the loop, return the sum variable.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def sum_even_and_even_index(lst):
    total = 0
    for index, value in enumerate(lst):
        if index % 2 == 0 and value % 2 == 0:
            total += value
    return total
```

This function will correctly compute the sum of even numbers located at even indices in the provided list. The assertion provided in the question can be used to test the function.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the sum of even numbers at even positions in a list, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a list as an argument.

2. **Initialize a Sum Variable**: Create a variable to keep track of the sum of the even numbers found at even indices.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to go through the list. You can use the `enumerate` function to get both the index and the value of each element in the list.

4. **Check Conditions**: For each element, check if the index is even (you can do this by checking if the index modulo 2 is zero) and if the value is even (again, check if the value modulo 2 is zero).

5. **Update the Sum**: If both conditions are met, add the value to the sum variable.

6. **Return the Result**: After the loop, return the sum variable.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def sum_even_and_even_index(lst):
    total = 0
    for index, value in enumerate(lst):
        if index % 2 == 0 and value % 2 == 0:
            total += value
    return total
```

This function will correctly compute the sum of even numbers located at even indices in the provided list. The assertion provided in the question can be used to test the function.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/270 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan to solve the task. The steps outlined are appropriate for creating a function that sums even numbers at even positions in a list.

Plan:
1) Define the function `sum_even_and_even_index` that takes a list as an argument.
2) Initialize a variable `total` to keep track of the sum.
3) Iterate through the list using `enumerate` to get both the index and the value.
4) Check if the index is even (index % 2 == 0) and if the value is even (value % 2 == 0).
5) If both conditions are true, add the value to `total`.
6) After the loop, return the `total` variable.

Code:
```python
def sum_even_and_even_index(lst):
    total = 0
    for index, value in enumerate(lst):
        if index % 2 == 0 and value % 2 == 0:
