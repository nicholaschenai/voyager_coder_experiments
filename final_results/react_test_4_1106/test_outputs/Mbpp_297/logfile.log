INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/297 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of flattening a nested list structure in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function named `flatten_list` that takes a single argument, which is the nested list.

2. **Initialize an Empty List**: Inside the function, create an empty list that will hold the flattened elements.

3. **Iterate Through the Input List**: Use a loop to iterate through each element of the input list. For each element, check its type.

4. **Check for Nested Lists**: If the current element is a list, you will need to recursively call the `flatten_list` function on that element to flatten it. This means that you will call the function again with the nested list as the argument.

5. **Append Elements**: If the current element is not a list (i.e., it is a base case like an integer), append it directly to the flattened list.

6. **Return the Result**: After processing all elements, return the flattened list.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def flatten_list(nested_list):
    flattened = []  # Step 2: Initialize an empty list
    for element in nested_list:  # Step 3: Iterate through the input list
        if isinstance(element, list):  # Step 4: Check if the element is a list
            flattened.extend(flatten_list(element))  # Recursive call for nested lists
        else:
            flattened.append(element)  # Step 5: Append non-list elements
    return flattened  # Step 6: Return the flattened list
```

This approach effectively handles any level of nesting in the list and produces a single flat list containing all the elements.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/297 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan to flatten a nested list structure. The steps outlined are appropriate for the task at hand.

Plan:
1) Define the function `flatten_list` that takes a single argument, `nested_list`, which is the list to be flattened.
2) Initialize an empty list called `flattened` that will store the flattened elements.
3) Iterate through each element in `nested_list`.
4) If an element is a list, recursively call `flatten_list` on that element and extend `flattened` with the result.
5) If an element is not a list, append it directly to `flattened`.
6) After the loop, return the `flattened` list.

Code:
```python
def flatten_list(nested_list):
    flattened = []  # Initialize an empty list to store flattened elements
    for element in nested_list:  # Iterate through each element in the nested list
        if isinstance(element, list):  # Check if the element is a list
