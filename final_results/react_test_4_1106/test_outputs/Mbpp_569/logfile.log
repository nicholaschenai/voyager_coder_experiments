INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/569 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of sorting each sublist of strings in a given list of lists in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function, for example, `sort_sublists`, that takes a list of lists as an argument.

2. **Iterate Over Sublists**: Use a loop to iterate over each sublist within the main list. You can use a list comprehension or a simple for loop for this purpose.

3. **Sort Each Sublist**: For each sublist, use the built-in `sorted()` function or the `sort()` method to sort the strings in that sublist. The `sorted()` function returns a new sorted list, while `sort()` modifies the list in place.

4. **Return the Result**: After sorting all the sublists, return the modified list of lists.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def sort_sublists(list_of_lists):
    # Iterate over each sublist
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        # Sort the sublist
        sublist.sort()  # or use sorted(sublist) to create a new sorted list
    return list_of_lists
```

5. **Testing the Function**: Finally, you can test the function using the provided assertion to ensure it works as expected.

By following these steps, you can effectively sort each sublist of strings in the given list of lists.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of sorting each sublist of strings in a given list of lists in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function, for example, `sort_sublists`, that takes a list of lists as an argument.

2. **Iterate Over Sublists**: Use a loop to iterate over each sublist within the main list. You can use a list comprehension or a simple for loop for this purpose.

3. **Sort Each Sublist**: For each sublist, use the built-in `sorted()` function or the `sort()` method to sort the strings in that sublist. The `sorted()` function returns a new sorted list, while `sort()` modifies the list in place.

4. **Return the Result**: After sorting all the sublists, return the modified list of lists.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def sort_sublists(list_of_lists):
    # Iterate over each sublist
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        # Sort the sublist
        sublist.sort()  # or use sorted(sublist) to create a new sorted list
    return list_of_lists
```

5. **Testing the Function**: Finally, you can test the function using the provided assertion to ensure it works as expected.

By following these steps, you can effectively sort each sublist of strings in the given list of lists.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/569 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a good starting point for the task. However, it suggests using the `sort()` method, which sorts the list in place and does not return it. Since we need to return the sorted list of lists, we should use the `sorted()` function within a list comprehension to create a new sorted list for each sublist.

Plan:
1) Define the function `sort_sublists` that takes a single argument, which is a list of lists of strings.
2) Use a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list.
3) For each sublist, use the `sorted()` function to sort the strings.
4) Return the new list of sorted sublists.

Code:
```python
def sort_sublists(list_of_lists):
    # Use a list comprehension to sort each sublist and return the new list of sorted sublists
    return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]
```

This code should pass the assertion provided in the task.
