INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/93 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to calculate the value of 'a' to the power 'b'.
assert power(3,4) == 81
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/93 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of writing a function that calculates the value of 'a' to the power 'b' in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function named `power` that takes two parameters, `a` (the base) and `b` (the exponent).

2. **Implement the Power Calculation**: Inside the function, you can use a loop or the built-in exponentiation operator `**` to calculate the result. The operator `a ** b` directly computes 'a' raised to the power of 'b'.

3. **Return the Result**: After calculating the power, return the result from the function.

4. **Testing the Function**: Use the `assert` statement to test the function with the provided example, ensuring that `power(3, 4)` returns `81`.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def power(a, b):
    return a ** b

# Test the function
assert power(3, 4) == 81
```

This function will correctly compute the power of 'a' raised to 'b' and pass the assertion test.

Here are some useful functions written earlier which you can reuse or reference.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

2) Inside the function, use the exponentiation operator `**` to calculate `a` raised to the power of `b`.
