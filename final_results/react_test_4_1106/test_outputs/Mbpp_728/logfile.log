INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/728 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of writing a function that takes two lists and returns a new list containing the element-wise sums of the two input lists, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function that accepts two lists as parameters.

2. **Initialize an Empty List**: Create an empty list that will hold the results of the element-wise sums.

3. **Iterate Over the Lists**: Use a loop to iterate through the indices of the lists. Since both lists are expected to be of the same length, you can use the `range` function to generate indices.

4. **Sum Corresponding Elements**: For each index, access the corresponding elements from both lists, sum them, and append the result to the results list.

5. **Return the Result**: After the loop completes, return the results list.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def sum_list(list_a, list_b):
    result = []  # Step 2: Initialize an empty list
    for i in range(len(list_a)):  # Step 3: Iterate over the indices
        result.append(list_a[i] + list_b[i])  # Step 4: Sum and append
    return result  # Step 5: Return the result
```

This function will correctly compute the element-wise sums of the two input lists as specified in the assertion.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

Answer: To accomplish the task of writing a function that takes two lists and returns a new list containing the element-wise sums of the two input lists, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function that accepts two lists as parameters.

```python

    result = []  # Step 2: Initialize an empty list

        result.append(list_a[i] + list_b[i])  # Step 4: Sum and append
    return result  # Step 5: Return the result
```

This function will correctly compute the element-wise sums of the two input lists as specified in the assertion.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/728 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan for implementing the function. It outlines the steps needed to create a function that takes two lists of equal length and returns a new list with the element-wise sums.

Plan:
1) Define the function `sum_list` with two parameters, `list_a` and `list_b`.
2) Use a list comprehension to iterate over both lists simultaneously and sum the corresponding elements.
3) Return the new list containing the summed elements.
