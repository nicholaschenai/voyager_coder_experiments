"""
Write a function to check whether the given number is undulating or not.
assert is_undulating(1212121) == True
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/92 [generation text] Answer: To determine if a number is undulating, we need to check if its digits alternate between two different values. An undulating number has the property that no two adjacent digits are the same, and it typically consists of only two distinct digits.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual approach to accomplish this task in Python:

1. **Convert the Number to a String**: This allows us to easily access each digit.

2. **Check for Adjacent Digits**: Loop through the string representation of the number and compare each digit with the next one. If any two adjacent digits are the same, the number is not undulating.

3. **Count Distinct Digits**: While checking for adjacent digits, we can also keep track of the distinct digits encountered. If we find more than two distinct digits, we can conclude that the number is not undulating.

4. **Return the Result**: If we finish checking all the digits without finding adjacent duplicates and have at most two distinct digits, we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of the above logic:

```python
def is_undulating(number):
    num_str = str(number)
    distinct_digits = set()
    
    for i in range(len(num_str) - 1):
        if num_str[i] == num_str[i + 1]:  # Check for adjacent duplicates
            return False
        distinct_digits.add(num_str[i])  # Add the digit to the set of distinct digits
    
    # Add the last digit to the set
    distinct_digits.add(num_str[-1])
    
    # Check if there are more than two distinct digits
    return len(distinct_digits) <= 2

# Example usage
assert is_undulating(1212121) == True
```

This function checks if the number is undulating by ensuring that no two adjacent digits are the same and that there are at most two distinct digits.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To determine if a number is undulating, we need to check if its digits alternate between two different values. An undulating number has the property that no two adjacent digits are the same, and it typically consists of only two distinct digits.

    distinct_digits = set()
    
    for i in range(len(num_str) - 1):
        if num_str[i] == num_str[i + 1]:  # Check for adjacent duplicates
            return False
        distinct_digits.add(num_str[i])  # Add the digit to the set of distinct digits
    
    # Add the last digit to the set
    distinct_digits.add(num_str[-1])
    
    # Check if there are more than two distinct digits
    return len(distinct_digits) <= 2

# Example usage
assert is_undulating(1212121) == True

This function checks if the number is undulating by ensuring that no two adjacent digits are the same and that there are at most two distinct digits.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/92 [generation text] Explain: The provided context outlines a plan to determine if a number is undulating by converting it to a string, checking for adjacent duplicates, and ensuring there are at most two distinct digits. However, the plan does not explicitly mention that an undulating number must also have a length of at least 3 to be considered undulating (since a single digit or a pair of different digits does not form an undulating pattern). This additional check should be included in the implementation.

Plan:
1) Convert the number to a string to access individual digits.
2) Check if the length of the string is less than 3; if so, return False because a number with less than 3 digits cannot be undulating.
3) Initialize a set to keep track of distinct digits.
4) Iterate over the string representation of the number, checking if any two adjacent digits are the same. If they are, return False.
5) Add each digit to the set of distinct digits.
6) After the loop, check if the set of distinct digits has more than two elements. If it does, return False.
7) If none of the above conditions are met, return True, indicating the number is undulating.

Code:
```python
def is_undulating(number):
    num_str = str(number)
    
    # An undulating number must have at least 3 digits
    if len(num_str) < 3:
        return False
    
    distinct_digits = set()
    
    for i in range(len(num_str) - 1):

        distinct_digits.add(num_str[i])  # Add the digit to the set of distinct digits
    
    # Add the last digit to the set
