INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/104 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of sorting each sublist of strings in a given list of lists in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function that takes a list of lists as an argument.

2. **Iterate Over Sublists**: Use a loop to iterate through each sublist in the main list.

3. **Sort Each Sublist**: For each sublist, use Python's built-in `sorted()` function or the `sort()` method to sort the strings in that sublist.

4. **Return the Result**: After sorting all the sublists, return the modified list of lists.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def sort_sublists(list_of_lists):
    # Iterate through each sublist
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        # Sort the sublist in place
        sublist.sort()  # or use sorted(sublist) to create a new sorted list

5. **Testing the Function**: You can use an assertion to test if the function works as expected by comparing the output of the function with the expected sorted list of lists.

By following these steps, you can effectively sort each sublist of strings within a list of lists in Python.

Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of sorting each sublist of strings in a given list of lists in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function that takes a list of lists as an argument.

2. **Iterate Over Sublists**: Use a loop to iterate through each sublist in the main list.

By following these steps, you can effectively sort each sublist of strings within a list of lists in Python.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/104 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a good starting point for the task. However, it suggests using the `sort()` method, which sorts the list in place and does not return it. Since we need to return the sorted sublists, we should use the `sorted()` function instead, which returns a new sorted list.

Plan:
1) Define the function `sort_sublists` that takes a tuple of lists as its argument.
2) Inside the function, iterate over each sublist in the tuple.
3) Use the `sorted()` function to sort each sublist.
4) Replace the original sublist with the sorted sublist.
5) Return the tuple of sorted sublists.

Code:
```python
def sort_sublists(list_of_lists):

You are a Python programming assistant that assesses my progress of Python programming and provides useful guidance.

I will give you the following information:

[Task]: The objective I need to accomplish.
[Context]: The context of the task. Serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help me on the task, but my priority is to follow instructions in the Task tag.
[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

You should only respond in JSON format as described below:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.
