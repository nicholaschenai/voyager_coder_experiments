"""
Write a python function to count the number of substrings with the sum of digits equal to their length.
assert count_Substrings('112112') == 6
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/61 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of counting the number of substrings in a given string of digits where the sum of the digits equals the length of the substring, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Iterate through all possible substrings**: You need to generate all possible substrings of the input string. This can be done using two nested loops: the outer loop will define the starting index of the substring, and the inner loop will define the ending index.

2. **Calculate the sum of digits**: For each substring generated, convert the characters to integers and calculate the sum of these digits.

3. **Check the condition**: Compare the calculated sum of the digits with the length of the substring. If they are equal, increment a counter.

4. **Return the count**: After checking all possible substrings, return the final count of substrings that meet the condition.

Here is a high-level outline of the function:

```python
def count_Substrings(s):
    count = 0
    n = len(s)
    
    # Iterate over all possible starting points
    for start in range(n):
        sum_digits = 0
        
        # Iterate over all possible ending points
        for end in range(start, n):
            sum_digits += int(s[end])  # Add the current digit to the sum
            length = end - start + 1    # Calculate the length of the substring
            
            # Check if the sum of digits equals the length
            if sum_digits == length:
                count += 1  # Increment the count if the condition is met
                
    return count
```

This function will correctly count the number of substrings where the sum of the digits equals the length of the substring, as demonstrated by the assertion `assert count_Substrings('112112') == 6`.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/61 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a rough plan that seems to be correct for solving the task. It outlines the steps needed to create a function that counts the number of substrings where the sum of the digits equals the length of the substring. The plan includes iterating through all possible substrings, calculating the sum of digits for each, checking if the sum equals the length, and incrementing a counter if it does.

Plan:
1) Define the function `count_Substrings` that takes a string `s` as an argument.
2) Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of valid substrings.
3) Use two nested loops to iterate over all possible substrings of `s`. The outer loop will iterate over the starting index, and the inner loop will iterate over the ending index.
4) For each substring, calculate the sum of its digits.
5) Check if the sum of the digits is equal to the length of the substring. If it is, increment the counter.
6) After all iterations, return the counter value.

Code:
```python
def count_Substrings(s: str) -> int:

    n = len(s)
