INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/479 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a python function to find the first digit of a given number.
assert first_Digit(123) == 1
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/479 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the first digit of a given number in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Convert the Number to a String**: By converting the number to a string, you can easily access its individual digits. This is because the first character of the string representation of the number will be the first digit.

2. **Handle Negative Numbers**: If the number can be negative, you should account for the negative sign. You can do this by checking if the number is negative and adjusting the string conversion accordingly.

3. **Extract the First Character**: Once you have the string representation of the number, you can access the first character (which represents the first digit).

4. **Convert Back to Integer**: Finally, convert the first character back to an integer to return it as the result.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps in a Python function:

```python
def first_Digit(num):
    # Convert the number to a string and handle negative numbers
    num_str = str(abs(num))
    # Return the first character converted back to an integer
    return int(num_str[0])

# Example usage
assert first_Digit(123) == 1
```

This function will correctly return the first digit of any given integer, whether it is positive or negative.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/479 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan to accomplish the task. It suggests converting the number to a string to easily access the first digit, handling negative numbers by taking the absolute value, and then converting the first character back to an integer.

Plan:
1) Define the function `first_Digit` that takes one argument, `num`.
2) Convert the number to a string after taking its absolute value to handle negative numbers.
3) Extract the first character of the string representation of the number.
4) Convert the first character back to an integer.
5) Return the integer.

Code:
```python
def first_Digit(num):
    # Convert the number to a string after taking its absolute value
    num_str = str(abs(num))
    # Extract the first character and convert it back to an integer
    return int(num_str[0])
