"""
Write a function to find squares of individual elements in a list.
assert square_nums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])==[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/8 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the squares of individual elements in a list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function named `square_nums` that takes a list as an argument.

2. **Iterate Over the List**: Use a loop (like a `for` loop) to iterate over each element in the input list.

3. **Calculate the Square**: For each element, calculate its square by multiplying the element by itself.

4. **Store the Results**: Create a new list to store the squared values.

5. **Return the New List**: After the loop completes, return the new list containing the squared values.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def square_nums(nums):
    # Create an empty list to hold the squared values
    squared_list = []
    
    # Iterate over each number in the input list
    for num in nums:
        # Calculate the square of the number
        squared_value = num * num
        # Append the squared value to the new list
        squared_list.append(squared_value)
    
    # Return the list of squared values
    return squared_list
```

You can then use the `assert` statement to verify that the function works as expected by checking if the output matches the expected result.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

"""

"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the squares of individual elements in a list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function named `square_nums` that takes a list as an argument.

2. **Iterate Over the List**: Use a loop (like a `for` loop) to iterate over each element in the input list.

3. **Calculate the Square**: For each element, calculate its square by multiplying the element by itself.

4. **Store the Results**: Create a new list to store the squared values.

5. **Return the New List**: After the loop completes, return the new list containing the squared values.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def square_nums(nums):
    # Create an empty list to hold the squared values
    squared_list = []
    
    # Iterate over each number in the input list
    for num in nums:
        # Calculate the square of the number
        squared_value = num * num
        # Append the squared value to the new list
        squared_list.append(squared_value)
    
    # Return the list of squared values
    return squared_list
```

You can then use the `assert` statement to verify that the function works as expected by checking if the output matches the expected result.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/8 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan to accomplish the task. The steps outlined are appropriate for creating a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list with the squares of those numbers.

Plan:
1) Define the function `square_nums` that takes a single argument, a list of numbers.
2) Inside the function, use a list comprehension to iterate over each element in the input list and calculate its square.
3) Return the new list containing the squared values.

Code:
```python
def square_nums(nums):
    return [num * num for num in nums]

# The following assertion will not be included in the code as per instructions
# assert square_nums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
