INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/554 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a python function which takes a list of integers and only returns the odd ones.
assert Split([1,2,3,4,5,6]) == [1,3,5]
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/554 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of writing a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns only the odd ones, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function, for example, `Split`, that takes a single parameter (the list of integers).

2. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop or a list comprehension to iterate through each integer in the provided list.

3. **Check for Odd Numbers**: For each integer, check if it is odd. In Python, an integer `n` is odd if `n % 2 != 0`.

4. **Collect Odd Numbers**: Create a new list to store the odd integers that you find during the iteration.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the list of odd integers.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def Split(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 != 0]
```

In this implementation, a list comprehension is used to create a new list that includes only the numbers that satisfy the condition of being odd. The `assert` statement can then be used to verify that the function works as expected.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/554 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan to implement the function. The function should iterate through the list of integers, check if each integer is odd, and return a list containing only the odd integers.

Plan:
1) Define the function `Split` that takes a single argument, a list of integers.
2) Use a list comprehension to iterate through the list and select only the integers that are odd (using the condition `num % 2 != 0`).
3) Return the new list containing only the odd integers.
