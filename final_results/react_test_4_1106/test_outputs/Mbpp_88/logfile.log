Write a function to get the frequency of all the elements in a list, returned as a dictionary.
assert freq_count([10,10,10,10,20,20,20,20,40,40,50,50,30])==({10: 4, 20: 4, 40: 2, 50: 2, 30: 1})
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/88 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of counting the frequency of elements in a list and returning the result as a dictionary in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a list as an argument.

2. **Initialize a Dictionary**: Create an empty dictionary to store the frequency of each element.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to go through each element in the list.

4. **Count Frequencies**: For each element, check if it is already a key in the dictionary:
   - If it is, increment its value (the count).
   - If it is not, add it to the dictionary with a value of 1.

5. **Return the Dictionary**: After processing all elements, return the dictionary containing the frequencies.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def freq_count(lst):
    frequency = {}
    for item in lst:
        if item in frequency:
            frequency[item] += 1
        else:
            frequency[item] = 1
    return frequency

# Example usage
assert freq_count([10,10,10,10,20,20,20,20,40,40,50,50,30]) == {10: 4, 20: 4, 40: 2, 50: 2, 30: 1}
```

This function will correctly count the occurrences of each element in the provided list and return the expected dictionary format.

Here are some useful functions written earlier which you can reuse or reference.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/88 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan to accomplish the task. The steps outlined are appropriate for creating a function that counts the frequency of elements in a list and returns a dictionary with these frequencies.

Plan:
1) Define the function `freq_count` that takes a single argument, a list of elements.
2) Initialize an empty dictionary to store the frequency of each element.
3) Iterate over each element in the list.
4) For each element, check if it is already a key in the dictionary. If it is, increment its value. If it is not, add it to the dictionary with a value of 1.
5) After iterating through the entire list, return the dictionary containing the frequencies of each element.

Code:
```python
def freq_count(lst):
    frequency = {}
    for item in lst:
        if item in frequency:
            frequency[item] += 1
