INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/450 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to extract specified size of strings from a given list of string values.
assert extract_string(['Python', 'list', 'exercises', 'practice', 'solution'] ,8)==['practice', 'solution']
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/450 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of extracting strings of a specified size from a given list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `extract_string` that takes two parameters: a list of strings and an integer representing the desired string length.

2. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to go through each string in the provided list.

3. **Check String Length**: For each string, check if its length matches the specified size.

4. **Collect Matching Strings**: If a string's length matches the specified size, add it to a new list that will hold the results.

5. **Return the Result**: After iterating through the entire list, return the new list containing only the strings that matched the specified length.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def extract_string(string_list, size):
    result = []  # Step 4: Initialize an empty list to hold matching strings
    for string in string_list:  # Step 2: Iterate through the list
        if len(string) == size:  # Step 3: Check if the string length matches the specified size
            result.append(string)  # Step 4: Add matching string to the result list
    return result  # Step 5: Return the list of matching strings
```

In the provided assertion, calling `extract_string(['Python', 'list', 'exercises', 'practice', 'solution'], 8)` would return `['practice', 'solution']`, as these are the strings in the list that have a length of 8.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Task]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to extract specified size of strings from a given list of string values.
assert extract_string(['Python', 'list', 'exercises', 'practice', 'solution'] ,8)==['practice', 'solution']
"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of extracting strings of a specified size from a given list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `extract_string` that takes two parameters: a list of strings and an integer representing the desired string length.

2. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to go through each string in the provided list.

3. **Check String Length**: For each string, check if its length matches the specified size.

4. **Collect Matching Strings**: If a string's length matches the specified size, add it to a new list that will hold the results.

5. **Return the Result**: After iterating through the entire list, return the new list containing only the strings that matched the specified length.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def extract_string(string_list, size):
    result = []  # Step 4: Initialize an empty list to hold matching strings
    for string in string_list:  # Step 2: Iterate through the list
        if len(string) == size:  # Step 3: Check if the string length matches the specified size
            result.append(string)  # Step 4: Add matching string to the result list
    return result  # Step 5: Return the list of matching strings
```

In the provided assertion, calling `extract_string(['Python', 'list', 'exercises', 'practice', 'solution'], 8)` would return `['practice', 'solution']`, as these are the strings in the list that have a length of 8.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/450 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan to accomplish the task. The steps outlined are appropriate for creating a function that extracts strings of a specified size from a given list.

Plan:
1) Define the function `extract_string` with two parameters: `string_list` (a list of strings) and `size` (an integer representing the desired string length).
2) Initialize an empty list called `result` to store the strings that match the specified size.
3) Iterate through each string in `string_list`.
4) For each string, check if its length is equal to `size`.
5) If the length matches, append the string to the `result` list.
6) After the loop, return the `result` list.

Code:
```python
def extract_string(string_list, size):
    result = []  # Initialize an empty list to hold matching strings
    for string in string_list:  # Iterate through the list
        if len(string) == size:  # Check if the string length matches the specified size
