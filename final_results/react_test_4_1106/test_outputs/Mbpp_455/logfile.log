"""
Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 31 days or not.
assert check_monthnumb_number(5)==True
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/455 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of checking whether a given month number contains 31 days in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `check_monthnumb_number` that takes a single argument, which will be the month number.

2. **Identify Months with 31 Days**: Create a list or a set of month numbers that correspond to months with 31 days. These months are January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12).

3. **Check Membership**: Use a conditional statement to check if the provided month number is in the list or set of months with 31 days.

4. **Return the Result**: Return `True` if the month number has 31 days, and `False` otherwise.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def check_monthnumb_number(month):
    # List of months that have 31 days
    months_with_31_days = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}
    
    # Check if the month is in the set of months with 31 days
    return month in months_with_31_days

# Example assertion
assert check_monthnumb_number(5) == True
```

In this implementation, the function checks if the input month is one of the months that have 31 days and returns the appropriate boolean value.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 31 days or not.

"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of checking whether a given month number contains 31 days in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `check_monthnumb_number` that takes a single argument, which will be the month number.

2. **Identify Months with 31 Days**: Create a list or a set of month numbers that correspond to months with 31 days. These months are January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12).

3. **Check Membership**: Use a conditional statement to check if the provided month number is in the list or set of months with 31 days.

4. **Return the Result**: Return `True` if the month number has 31 days, and `False` otherwise.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def check_monthnumb_number(month):
    # List of months that have 31 days
    months_with_31_days = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}
    
    # Check if the month is in the set of months with 31 days
    return month in months_with_31_days

# Example assertion
assert check_monthnumb_number(5) == True
```

In this implementation, the function checks if the input month is one of the months that have 31 days and returns the appropriate boolean value.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/455 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan to implement the function `check_monthnumb_number`. The function should take an integer representing the month number and return a boolean indicating whether that month has 31 days. The provided implementation in the context is correct and should work as expected.

Plan:
1) Define the function `check_monthnumb_number` that takes one argument, `month`, which is an integer.
2) Inside the function, create a set of integers representing the months that have 31 days: January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12).
3) Check if the `month` argument is in the set of months with 31 days.
4) Return `True` if the month is in the set, otherwise return `False`.

Code:
```python
def check_monthnumb_number(month):
    # Set of months that have 31 days
    months_with_31_days = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}
