"""
Write a function to flatten a list and sum all of its elements.
assert recursive_list_sum(([1, 2, [3,4],[5,6]]))==21
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/65 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of flattening a list and summing all of its elements in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `recursive_list_sum` that takes a list as an argument.

2. **Initialize a Sum Variable**: Inside the function, initialize a variable to keep track of the total sum of the elements.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to iterate through each element in the list.

4. **Check for Nested Lists**: For each element, check if it is a list itself. If it is, you will need to call the function recursively on that nested list.

5. **Sum the Elements**: If the element is not a list (i.e., it is a number), add it to the sum variable.

6. **Return the Total Sum**: After iterating through all elements, return the total sum.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def recursive_list_sum(lst):
    total_sum = 0
    for element in lst:
        if isinstance(element, list):
            total_sum += recursive_list_sum(element)  # Recursive call for nested lists
        else:
            total_sum += element  # Add the number to the total sum
    return total_sum
```

This function will correctly flatten the list and sum all its elements, as demonstrated by the assertion `assert recursive_list_sum(([1, 2, [3, 4], [5, 6]])) == 21`.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

assert recursive_list_sum(([1, 2, [3,4],[5,6]]))==21

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of flattening a list and summing all of its elements in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `recursive_list_sum` that takes a list as an argument.

2. **Initialize a Sum Variable**: Inside the function, initialize a variable to keep track of the total sum of the elements.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to iterate through each element in the list.

4. **Check for Nested Lists**: For each element, check if it is a list itself. If it is, you will need to call the function recursively on that nested list.

5. **Sum the Elements**: If the element is not a list (i.e., it is a number), add it to the sum variable.

6. **Return the Total Sum**: After iterating through all elements, return the total sum.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def recursive_list_sum(lst):
    total_sum = 0
    for element in lst:
        if isinstance(element, list):
            total_sum += recursive_list_sum(element)  # Recursive call for nested lists
        else:
            total_sum += element  # Add the number to the total sum
    return total_sum
```

This function will correctly flatten the list and sum all its elements, as demonstrated by the assertion `assert recursive_list_sum(([1, 2, [3, 4], [5, 6]])) == 21`.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/65 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan for implementing the `recursive_list_sum` function. The steps outlined are appropriate for recursively flattening a list and summing its elements. The provided code snippet is a good starting point and aligns with the task requirements.

Plan:
1) Define the function `recursive_list_sum` that takes a single argument, which is a list.
2) Initialize a variable `total_sum` to keep track of the sum of all elements.
3) Iterate through each element in the list.
4) If an element is a list, call `recursive_list_sum` recursively and add the result to `total_sum`.
5) If an element is not a list, add its value to `total_sum`.
6) Return the value of `total_sum` after the iteration is complete.

```python
def recursive_list_sum(lst):
    total_sum = 0
