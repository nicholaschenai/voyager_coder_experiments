INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/91 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to check if a string is present as a substring in a given list of string values.
assert find_substring(["red", "black", "white", "green", "orange"],"ack")==True
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/91 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of checking if a string is present as a substring in a given list of string values, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `find_substring` that takes two parameters: a list of strings and a substring to search for.

2. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to iterate through each string in the provided list.

3. **Check for Substring**: For each string in the list, use the `in` operator to check if the substring is present within that string.

4. **Return Result**: If the substring is found in any of the strings, return `True`. If the loop completes without finding the substring, return `False`.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def find_substring(string_list, substring):
    for string in string_list:
        if substring in string:
            return True
    return False
```

With this function, you can then use the provided assertion to check if it works correctly:

```python
assert find_substring(["red", "black", "white", "green", "orange"], "ack") == True
```

This assertion will pass if the function is implemented correctly, as "ack" is indeed a substring of "black".

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]

Answer: To accomplish the task of checking if a string is present as a substring in a given list of string values, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `find_substring` that takes two parameters: a list of strings and a substring to search for.

2. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to iterate through each string in the provided list.

3. **Check for Substring**: For each string in the list, use the `in` operator to check if the substring is present within that string.

4. **Return Result**: If the substring is found in any of the strings, return `True`. If the loop completes without finding the substring, return `False`.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def find_substring(string_list, substring):
    for string in string_list:
        if substring in string:
            return True
    return False
```

With this function, you can then use the provided assertion to check if it works correctly:

```python
assert find_substring(["red", "black", "white", "green", "orange"], "ack") == True
```

This assertion will pass if the function is implemented correctly, as "ack" is indeed a substring of "black".

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/91 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan for implementing the function. The steps outlined are appropriate for the task at hand.

Plan:
1) Define the function `find_substring` with two parameters: `string_list` (a list of strings) and `substring` (the string to search for).
2) Iterate through each string in `string_list`.
3) Check if `substring` is present in the current string using the `in` operator.
4) If `substring` is found, return `True`.
5) If the loop completes without finding the `substring`, return `False`.

Code:
```python
def find_substring(string_list, substring):
    for string in string_list:
        if substring in string:
            return True
    return False
