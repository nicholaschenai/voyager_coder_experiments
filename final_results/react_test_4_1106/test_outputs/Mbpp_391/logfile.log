INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/391 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of converting multiple lists into a nested dictionary in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function named `convert_list_dictionary` that takes three lists as parameters.

2. **Check Input Lengths**: Ensure that all input lists are of the same length. This is important because each element in the lists corresponds to a specific entry in the final nested dictionary.

3. **Initialize an Empty List**: Create an empty list that will hold the resulting nested dictionaries.

4. **Iterate Over the Lists**: Use a loop (like a `for` loop) to iterate over the indices of the lists. For each index, you will:
   - Retrieve the corresponding elements from each list (e.g., student ID, name, and score).
   - Create a nested dictionary for each entry, where the outer key is the student ID, and the value is another dictionary containing the student's name as the key and the score as the value.

5. **Append to Result List**: Add each nested dictionary to the result list.

6. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the list of nested dictionaries.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def convert_list_dictionary(ids, names, scores):
    # Step 2: Check if all lists are of the same length
    if len(ids) != len(names) or len(ids) != len(scores):
        raise ValueError("All input lists must have the same length.")
    
    result = []  # Step 3: Initialize an empty list
    
    # Step 4: Iterate over the indices of the lists
    for i in range(len(ids)):
        # Create the nested dictionary for each entry
        nested_dict = {ids[i]: {names[i]: scores[i]}}
        result.append(nested_dict)  # Step 5: Append to result list
    
    # Step 6: Return the result
    return result
```

This function will produce the desired output when called with the provided lists.

Here are some useful functions written earlier which you can reuse or reference.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
