"""
Write a function to find the lateral surface area of a cylinder.
assert math.isclose(lateralsuface_cylinder(10,5), 314.15000000000003, rel_tol=0.001)
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/233 [generation text] Answer: To find the lateral surface area of a cylinder in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand the Formula**: The lateral surface area (LSA) of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{LSA} = 2 \pi r h
   \]
   where \( r \) is the radius of the cylinder's base and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

2. **Import Required Libraries**: Since the formula involves Ï€ (pi), you will need to import the `math` module to access the constant `math.pi`.

3. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `lateralsurface_cylinder` that takes two parameters: `radius` and `height`.

4. **Calculate the Lateral Surface Area**: Inside the function, use the formula to compute the lateral surface area using the provided radius and height.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the calculated lateral surface area from the function.

6. **Testing the Function**: Use the `assert` statement to test the function with the provided values to ensure it returns the expected result.

Here is a conceptual outline of the code:

```python
import math

def lateralsurface_cylinder(radius, height):
    # Calculate the lateral surface area
    return 2 * math.pi * radius * height

# Example assertion to test the function
assert math.isclose(lateralsurface_cylinder(10, 5), 314.15, rel_tol=0.001)
```

This code defines the function and checks if it correctly calculates the lateral surface area of a cylinder with a radius of 10 and a height of 5.
