INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/111 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding common elements in given nested lists in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand the Input**: You have a list of lists (nested lists) where each inner list contains integers. Your goal is to identify the integers that appear in every inner list.

2. **Use Sets for Intersection**: Sets in Python are a great way to handle this problem because they allow for efficient membership testing and provide an easy way to find common elements using set operations.

3. **Initialize the Common Set**: Start by converting the first inner list into a set. This will serve as the initial set of common elements.

4. **Iterate Through Remaining Lists**: For each subsequent inner list, convert it into a set and perform an intersection with the current set of common elements. The intersection will update the common elements to only those that are present in both sets.

5. **Return the Result**: After processing all inner lists, the resulting set will contain only the elements that are common to all lists. You can then return this set.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def common_in_nested_lists(nested_lists):
    # Start with the first list as a set
    common_elements = set(nested_lists[0])
    
    # Iterate through the remaining lists
    for inner_list in nested_lists[1:]:
        # Update common_elements to the intersection with the current list
        common_elements.intersection_update(inner_list)
    
    return common_elements
```

This function will effectively find and return the common elements across all the nested lists. The use of `intersection_update` modifies the set in place, keeping only the elements that are also in the provided iterable (the current inner list).

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/111 [generation text] Explain: The provided context gives a good explanation of how to approach the task. The plan is to use set intersection to find common elements in all nested lists. The provided code snippet is a good starting point, but it needs to be adjusted to match the function name specified in the task and to ensure it works correctly with the given input.

Plan:
1) Define the function `common_in_nested_lists` that takes one argument, `nested_lists`, which is a list of lists.
2) Convert the first inner list into a set to initialize the set of common elements.
3) Iterate through the remaining inner lists, converting each into a set and updating the common elements set with the intersection of the current set and the new set.
4) Return the common elements as a list since the assert statement expects the function to return a list, not a set.

Code:
```python
def common_in_nested_lists(nested_lists):
    # Initialize the set of common elements with the first inner list
    common_elements = set(nested_lists[0])
    
    # Iterate through the remaining lists
    for inner_list in nested_lists[1:]:
        # Perform intersection with the current set of common elements
        common_elements.intersection_update(inner_list)
    
    # Return the common elements as a list
    return list(common_elements)
```

This function should pass the assertion provided in the task.
