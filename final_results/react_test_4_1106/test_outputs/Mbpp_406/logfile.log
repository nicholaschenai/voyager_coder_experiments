INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/406 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a python function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd.
assert find_Parity(12) == False
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/406 [generation text] Answer: To determine whether the parity of a given number is odd in Python, you can create a function called `find_Parity`. The concept of parity refers to whether a number is even or odd. A number is considered odd if it is not divisible by 2, which can be checked using the modulus operator `%`.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of how to accomplish this task:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function named `find_Parity` that takes one parameter (the number you want to check).

2. **Check for Odd Parity**: Inside the function, use the modulus operator to check if the number is odd. Specifically, you can check if `number % 2 != 0`. If this condition is true, the number is odd.

3. **Return the Result**: The function should return `True` if the number is odd and `False` if it is even.

4. **Testing the Function**: You can use an assertion to test the function, as shown in the example. The assertion checks if the function returns `False` for the input `12`, which is an even number.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def find_Parity(number):
    return number % 2 != 0

# Example assertion
assert find_Parity(12) == False
```

In this implementation, `find_Parity(12)` returns `False`, indicating that `12` is not odd, which satisfies the assertion.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To determine whether the parity of a given number is odd in Python, you can create a function called `find_Parity`. The concept of parity refers to whether a number is even or odd. A number is considered odd if it is not divisible by 2, which can be checked using the modulus operator `%`.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of how to accomplish this task:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function named `find_Parity` that takes one parameter (the number you want to check).

2. **Check for Odd Parity**: Inside the function, use the modulus operator to check if the number is odd. Specifically, you can check if `number % 2 != 0`. If this condition is true, the number is odd.

3. **Return the Result**: The function should return `True` if the number is odd and `False` if it is even.

4. **Testing the Function**: You can use an assertion to test the function, as shown in the example. The assertion checks if the function returns `False` for the input `12`, which is an even number.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def find_Parity(number):
    return number % 2 != 0

# Example assertion
assert find_Parity(12) == False
```

In this implementation, `find_Parity(12)` returns `False`, indicating that `12` is not odd, which satisfies the assertion.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/406 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct explanation of how to determine the parity of a number and suggests a function that returns `True` if the number is odd and `False` otherwise. However, the function name in the context does not follow the naming convention specified in the task. The task requires the function name to be `find_Parity` with a capital 'P'.

Plan:
1) Define the function `find_Parity` with one parameter, `number`.
2) Inside the function, use the modulus operator `%` to check if the number is odd by evaluating `number % 2 != 0`.
3) Return `True` if the number is odd, otherwise return `False`.
