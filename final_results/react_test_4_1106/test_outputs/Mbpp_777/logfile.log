"""
Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
assert find_sum([1,2,3,1,1,4,5,6]) == 21
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/777 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Count Occurrences**: Use a data structure to count how many times each element appears in the list. A dictionary or the `collections.Counter` class can be useful for this purpose.

2. **Identify Non-Repeated Elements**: After counting the occurrences, filter the elements to find those that appear exactly once.

3. **Calculate the Sum**: Finally, sum up the values of the non-repeated elements.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual outline of the function:

- Initialize a counter to keep track of the occurrences of each element.
- Iterate through the list and update the counter for each element.
- Create a sum variable to accumulate the total of non-repeated elements.
- Iterate through the counter and add the elements that have a count of one to the sum.
- Return the final sum.

This approach ensures that you efficiently count and sum the non-repeated elements in the list. 

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic:

```python
from collections import Counter

def find_sum(lst):
    count = Counter(lst)  # Count occurrences of each element
    return sum(key for key, value in count.items() if value == 1)  # Sum non-repeated elements

# Example usage
assert find_sum([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]) == 21
```

This function will correctly compute the sum of non-repeated elements in the provided list.

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Count Occurrences**: Use a data structure to count how many times each element appears in the list. A dictionary or the `collections.Counter` class can be useful for this purpose.

2. **Identify Non-Repeated Elements**: After counting the occurrences, filter the elements to find those that appear exactly once.

3. **Calculate the Sum**: Finally, sum up the values of the non-repeated elements.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual outline of the function:

- Initialize a counter to keep track of the occurrences of each element.
- Iterate through the list and update the counter for each element.
- Create a sum variable to accumulate the total of non-repeated elements.
- Iterate through the counter and add the elements that have a count of one to the sum.
- Return the final sum.

This approach ensures that you efficiently count and sum the non-repeated elements in the list. 

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic:

```python
from collections import Counter

def find_sum(lst):
    count = Counter(lst)  # Count occurrences of each element
    return sum(key for key, value in count.items() if value == 1)  # Sum non-repeated elements

# Example usage
assert find_sum([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]) == 21
```

This function will correctly compute the sum of non-repeated elements in the provided list.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/777 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct approach to solve the task. It suggests using a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each element in the list and then summing up the elements that appear exactly once.

Plan:
1) Import the `Counter` class from the `collections` module.
2) Define the function `find_sum` that takes a list as an argument.
3) Inside the function, create a `Counter` object to count the occurrences of each element in the list.

"""

[Context]: 
 Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Count Occurrences**: Use a data structure to count how many times each element appears in the list. A dictionary or the `collections.Counter` class can be useful for this purpose.

2. **Identify Non-Repeated Elements**: After counting the occurrences, filter the elements to find those that appear exactly once.

3. **Calculate the Sum**: Finally, sum up the values of the non-repeated elements.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual outline of the function:

- Initialize a counter to keep track of the occurrences of each element.
- Iterate through the list and update the counter for each element.
- Create a sum variable to accumulate the total of non-repeated elements.
- Iterate through the counter and add the elements that have a count of one to the sum.
- Return the final sum.

This approach ensures that you efficiently count and sum the non-repeated elements in the list. 

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic:

```python
from collections import Counter

def find_sum(lst):
    count = Counter(lst)  # Count occurrences of each element
    return sum(key for key, value in count.items() if value == 1)  # Sum non-repeated elements

# Example usage
assert find_sum([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]) == 21
```

This function will correctly compute the sum of non-repeated elements in the provided list.

It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

"""
Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
assert find_sum([1,2,3,1,1,4,5,6]) == 21
"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Count Occurrences**: Use a data structure to count how many times each element appears in the list. A dictionary or the `collections.Counter` class can be useful for this purpose.

2. **Identify Non-Repeated Elements**: After counting the occurrences, filter the elements to find those that appear exactly once.

3. **Calculate the Sum**: Finally, sum up the values of the non-repeated elements.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual outline of the function:

- Initialize a counter to keep track of the occurrences of each element.
- Iterate through the list and update the counter for each element.
- Create a sum variable to accumulate the total of non-repeated elements.
- Iterate through the counter and add the elements that have a count of one to the sum.
- Return the final sum.

This approach ensures that you efficiently count and sum the non-repeated elements in the list. 

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic:

```python
from collections import Counter

def find_sum(lst):
    count = Counter(lst)  # Count occurrences of each element
    return sum(key for key, value in count.items() if value == 1)  # Sum non-repeated elements

# Example usage
assert find_sum([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]) == 21
```

This function will correctly compute the sum of non-repeated elements in the provided list.


[Critique]
The function implementation seems correct at first glance, but the test case failure suggests that there might be an issue with the test case itself or the way the sum is calculated. Since the function uses a generator expression within the sum function, it should correctly calculate the sum of non-repeated elements. It's possible that the test case assertion is incorrect. Double-check the test case to ensure it matches the task requirements. If the test case is correct, then manually verify the sum of non-repeated elements in the list to identify the discrepancy.


INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/777 [generation text] Explain: The test case assertion failed because the function `find_sum` incorrectly sums only the keys of the non-repeated elements. The correct approach is to sum the values of the non-repeated elements, not their keys.

Plan:
1) Use the `collections.Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the list.
2) Iterate through the items of the counter.
3) Check if the value (count) of each item is equal to 1, which means the element is non-repeated.
4) Sum the keys (actual elements) of the non-repeated items.
5) Return the sum.

Code:
```python
from collections import Counter

def find_sum(lst):
    count = Counter(lst)  # Count occurrences of each element
    return sum(key for key, value in count.items() if value == 1)  # Sum non-repeated elements

You are a Python programming assistant that assesses my progress of Python programming and provides useful guidance.

I will give you the following information:

[Task]: The objective I need to accomplish.
[Context]: The context of the task. Serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help me on the task, but my priority is to follow instructions in the Task tag.
[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)
