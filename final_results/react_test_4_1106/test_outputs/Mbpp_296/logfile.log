Write a python function to count inversions in an array.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/296 [generation text] Answer: To count inversions in an array, you can use a modified version of the merge sort algorithm. An inversion is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and array[i] > array[j]. 

Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of how to accomplish this:

1. **Divide and Conquer**: Use the merge sort technique to divide the array into two halves recursively until you reach arrays of size one.

2. **Count Inversions During Merge**: While merging the two halves back together, count the inversions:
   - If an element from the left half is less than or equal to an element from the right half, it is in the correct order, and you can simply add it to the merged array.
   - If an element from the left half is greater than an element from the right half, then all remaining elements in the left half (since they are sorted) will also be greater than the current element from the right half. This means that the number of inversions contributed by this element is equal to the number of remaining elements in the left half.

3. **Combine Counts**: The total number of inversions is the sum of the inversions counted in the left half, the right half, and those counted during the merge step.

Hereâ€™s a high-level outline of the function:

```python
def merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right):
    i = left    # Starting index for left subarray
    j = mid + 1 # Starting index for right subarray
    k = left    # Starting index to be sorted
    inv_count = 0

    while i <= mid and j <= right:
        if arr[i] <= arr[j]:
            temp_arr[k] = arr[i]
            i += 1
        else:
            temp_arr[k] = arr[j]
            inv_count += (mid - i + 1)  # Count inversions
            j += 1
        k += 1

    while i <= mid:
        temp_arr[k] = arr[i]
        i += 1
        k += 1

    while j <= right:
        temp_arr[k] = arr[j]
        j += 1
        k += 1

    for i in range(left, right + 1):
        arr[i] = temp_arr[i]

    return inv_count

def merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, right):
    inv_count = 0
    if left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2

        inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid)
        inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, mid + 1, right)
        inv_count += merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right)

    return inv_count

def get_Inv_Count(arr):
    temp_arr = [0] * len(arr)
    return merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, 0, len(arr) - 1)

# Example usage
assert get_Inv_Count([1, 20, 6, 4, 5]) == 5
```

This function will efficiently count the number of inversions in the array using O(n log n) time complexity, which is much better than the naive O(n^2) approach.

At each round of conversation, I will give you

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To count inversions in an array, you can use a modified version of the merge sort algorithm. An inversion is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and array[i] > array[j]. 

Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of how to accomplish this:

   - If an element from the left half is greater than an element from the right half, then all remaining elements in the left half (since they are sorted) will also be greater than the current element from the right half. This means that the number of inversions contributed by this element is equal to the number of remaining elements in the left half.

3. **Combine Counts**: The total number of inversions is the sum of the inversions counted in the left half, the right half, and those counted during the merge step.

Hereâ€™s a high-level outline of the function:

```python

        inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, mid + 1, right)

    return inv_count

def get_Inv_Count(arr):
    temp_arr = [0] * len(arr)

This function will efficiently count the number of inversions in the array using O(n log n) time complexity, which is much better than the naive O(n^2) approach.
