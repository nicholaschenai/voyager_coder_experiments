INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/80 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to find the nth tetrahedral number.
assert tetrahedral_number(5) == 35
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/80 [generation text] Answer: To find the nth tetrahedral number in Python, you can use the formula for the nth tetrahedral number, which is given by:

\[ T_n = \frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6} \]

This formula calculates the number of spheres that can form a tetrahedron with n layers. 

Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of how to implement this in a function:

1. **Define the function**: Create a function named `tetrahedral_number` that takes an integer `n` as an argument.

2. **Apply the formula**: Inside the function, use the formula to compute the nth tetrahedral number. You will need to multiply `n`, `n+1`, and `n+2`, and then divide the result by 6.

3. **Return the result**: Finally, return the computed tetrahedral number.

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def tetrahedral_number(n):
    return n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6  # Use integer division for the result

# Example usage
assert tetrahedral_number(5) == 35
```

In this implementation, the function calculates the tetrahedral number for the given `n` and the assertion checks if the function works correctly for the input `5`.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To find the nth tetrahedral number in Python, you can use the formula for the nth tetrahedral number, which is given by:

\[ T_n = \frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6} \]

This formula calculates the number of spheres that can form a tetrahedron with n layers. 

Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of how to implement this in a function:

1. **Define the function**: Create a function named `tetrahedral_number` that takes an integer `n` as an argument.

2. **Apply the formula**: Inside the function, use the formula to compute the nth tetrahedral number. You will need to multiply `n`, `n+1`, and `n+2`, and then divide the result by 6.

3. **Return the result**: Finally, return the computed tetrahedral number.

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def tetrahedral_number(n):
    return n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6  # Use integer division for the result

# Example usage

```

In this implementation, the function calculates the tetrahedral number for the given `n` and the assertion checks if the function works correctly for the input `5`.
