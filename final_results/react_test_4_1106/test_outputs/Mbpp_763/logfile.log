"""
Write a python function to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. 
assert find_min_diff((1,5,3,19,18,25),6) == 1
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/763 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Sort the Array**: Start by sorting the array. This will allow you to easily find the minimum difference by only comparing adjacent elements, as the smallest difference will occur between the closest numbers.

2. **Initialize a Variable**: Create a variable to keep track of the minimum difference. You can initialize it to a large value (like infinity) to ensure that any found difference will be smaller.

3. **Iterate Through the Sorted Array**: Loop through the sorted array and calculate the difference between each pair of adjacent elements. Update the minimum difference variable whenever you find a smaller difference.

4. **Return the Result**: After completing the loop, return the minimum difference found.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def find_min_diff(arr, n):
    # Step 1: Sort the array
    sorted_arr = sorted(arr)
    
    # Step 2: Initialize min_diff to a large value
    min_diff = float('inf')
    
    # Step 3: Iterate through the sorted array
    for i in range(n - 1):
        # Calculate the difference between adjacent elements
        diff = sorted_arr[i + 1] - sorted_arr[i]
        # Update min_diff if a smaller difference is found
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            
    # Step 4: Return the minimum difference
    return min_diff
```

In this function, `arr` is the input array, and `n` is its length. The function sorts the array, calculates the differences, and returns the minimum difference, which can be asserted as shown in the example.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

            min_diff = diff

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/763 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan to solve the task. The steps outlined are appropriate for finding the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. The provided code snippet is also correct and follows the task requirements. However, the code snippet is just a conceptual outline and not the final implementation. I will now provide the final implementation of the function.

Plan:
1) Define the function `find_min_diff` that takes a tuple `arr` and an integer `n` as arguments.
2) Sort the tuple `arr`.
3) Initialize a variable `min_diff` with a large value, such as `float('inf')`.
4) Iterate through the sorted tuple using a loop from index 0 to `n-2` (since we'll be comparing with the next element).
5) Calculate the difference between each pair of adjacent elements.
6) If the calculated difference is smaller than `min_diff`, update `min_diff` with this new value.
7) After the loop, return the value of `min_diff`.

Code:
```python
def find_min_diff(arr, n):
    # Step 1: Sort the array
    sorted_arr = sorted(arr)
    
    # Step 2: Initialize min_diff to a large value
    min_diff = float('inf')
