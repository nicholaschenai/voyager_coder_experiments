"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/743 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of rotating a list to the right by a specified number of items in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand the Rotation**: When you rotate a list to the right, the last elements of the list move to the front. For example, rotating the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` by 2 positions to the right results in `[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]`.

2. **Handle the Rotation Count**: If the number of positions to rotate exceeds the length of the list, you can use the modulo operator to reduce the number of rotations. For instance, rotating a list of length 10 by 12 positions is equivalent to rotating it by 2 positions (`12 % 10 = 2`).

3. **Slice the List**: You can use list slicing to achieve the rotation. The last `n` elements can be obtained using `list[-n:]`, and the rest of the list can be obtained using `list[:-n]`. Concatenating these two slices will give you the rotated list.

4. **Define the Function**: Create a function that takes the list and the number of positions to rotate as arguments. Inside the function, implement the slicing logic and return the new rotated list.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def rotate_right(lst, n):
    n = n % len(lst)  # Handle cases where n is greater than the length of the list
    return lst[-n:] + lst[:-n]  # Concatenate the last n elements with the rest of the list
```

5. **Testing the Function**: Use assertions to test the function with various cases, including edge cases like rotating by 0 or by the length of the list.

By following these steps, you can effectively rotate a list to the right by a specified number of items in Python.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/743 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct approach to solve the task. We need to create a function that rotates a list to the right by a specified number of positions. The modulo operation is used to handle cases where the rotation count exceeds the length of the list, and list slicing is used to perform the rotation.

Plan:
1) Define the function `rotate_right` that takes two parameters: `lst` (the list to rotate) and `n` (the number of positions to rotate the list by).
2) Use the modulo operator to adjust `n` if it is greater than the length of the list.
3) Use list slicing to create two sublists: one containing the last `n` elements and the other containing the rest of the list.
4) Concatenate the sublist containing the last `n` elements with the sublist containing the rest of the list to form the rotated list.
5) Return the rotated list.

Code:
```python
def rotate_right(lst, n):
    # Adjust n if it is greater than the length of the list
    n = n % len(lst)
    # Concatenate the last n elements with the rest of the list
    return lst[-n:] + lst[:-n]
```

This function should pass the assertion provided in the task.
