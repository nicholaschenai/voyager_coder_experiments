"""
Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
assert remove_dirty_chars("probasscurve", "pros") == 'bacuve'
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/18 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of removing characters from the first string that are present in the second string, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `remove_dirty_chars` that takes two parameters: the first string (from which characters will be removed) and the second string (which contains the characters to be removed).

2. **Iterate Through the First String**: Use a loop or a comprehension to go through each character in the first string.

3. **Check for Existence in the Second String**: For each character in the first string, check if it is present in the second string. This can be done using the `in` keyword.

4. **Build a New String**: If a character from the first string is not found in the second string, include it in a new string. You can use a list to collect these characters and then join them together at the end.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the new string that contains only the characters from the first string that are not present in the second string.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def remove_dirty_chars(str1, str2):
    return ''.join(char for char in str1 if char not in str2)

# Example usage
assert remove_dirty_chars("probasscurve", "pros") == 'bacuve'
```

In this implementation, a generator expression is used to filter out the unwanted characters efficiently, and `join` is used to create the final string.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of removing characters from the first string that are present in the second string, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `remove_dirty_chars` that takes two parameters: the first string (from which characters will be removed) and the second string (which contains the characters to be removed).

2. **Iterate Through the First String**: Use a loop or a comprehension to go through each character in the first string.

3. **Check for Existence in the Second String**: For each character in the first string, check if it is present in the second string. This can be done using the `in` keyword.

4. **Build a New String**: If a character from the first string is not found in the second string, include it in a new string. You can use a list to collect these characters and then join them together at the end.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the new string that contains only the characters from the first string that are not present in the second string.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def remove_dirty_chars(str1, str2):
    return ''.join(char for char in str1 if char not in str2)

# Example usage
assert remove_dirty_chars("probasscurve", "pros") == 'bacuve'
```

In this implementation, a generator expression is used to filter out the unwanted characters efficiently, and `join` is used to create the final string.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/18 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan to solve the task. The steps outlined are appropriate for creating a function that removes characters from the first string which are present in the second string.

Plan:
1) Define the function `remove_dirty_chars` with two parameters, `str1` and `str2`.
2) Use a generator expression to iterate through each character in `str1`.
3) For each character, check if it is not in `str2`.
4) Use the `join` method to concatenate the characters that are not in `str2` into a new string.
5) Return the new string.

Code:
```python
def remove_dirty_chars(str1, str2):
    # Use a generator expression to filter out characters from str1 that are in str2
    return ''.join(char for char in str1 if char not in str2)

# The assertion will be executed outside of this function to test its correctness
