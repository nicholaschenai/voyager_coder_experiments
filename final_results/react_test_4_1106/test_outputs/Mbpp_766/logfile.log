"""
Write a function to return a list of all pairs of consecutive items in a given list.

"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/766 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of returning a list of all pairs of consecutive items in a given list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function, for example, `pair_wise`, that takes a list as an argument.

2. **Initialize an Empty List**: Inside the function, create an empty list that will hold the pairs of consecutive items.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to iterate through the indices of the list. You can use the `range` function to loop from the first index (0) to the second-to-last index (length of the list minus one).

4. **Create Pairs**: For each index in the loop, create a tuple containing the current item and the next item in the list. This can be done by accessing the current index and the next index (current index + 1).

5. **Append Pairs to the List**: Add each created tuple to the list of pairs.

6. **Return the List**: After the loop completes, return the list of pairs.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def pair_wise(lst):
    pairs = []  # Step 2: Initialize an empty list
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):  # Step 3: Iterate through the list
        pairs.append((lst[i], lst[i + 1]))  # Step 4: Create and append pairs
    return pairs  # Step 6: Return the list of pairs
```

This function will then produce the desired output when called with the provided list.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of returning a list of all pairs of consecutive items in a given list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function, for example, `pair_wise`, that takes a list as an argument.

2. **Initialize an Empty List**: Inside the function, create an empty list that will hold the pairs of consecutive items.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to iterate through the indices of the list. You can use the `range` function to loop from the first index (0) to the second-to-last index (length of the list minus one).

4. **Create Pairs**: For each index in the loop, create a tuple containing the current item and the next item in the list. This can be done by accessing the current index and the next index (current index + 1).

5. **Append Pairs to the List**: Add each created tuple to the list of pairs.

6. **Return the List**: After the loop completes, return the list of pairs.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def pair_wise(lst):
    pairs = []  # Step 2: Initialize an empty list
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):  # Step 3: Iterate through the list
        pairs.append((lst[i], lst[i + 1]))  # Step 4: Create and append pairs
    return pairs  # Step 6: Return the list of pairs
```

This function will then produce the desired output when called with the provided list.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/766 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan to accomplish the task. It outlines the steps needed to create a function that returns a list of all pairs of consecutive items in a given list.

Plan:
1) Define the function `pair_wise` that takes a single argument, which is a list.
2) Initialize an empty list to store the pairs of consecutive items.
3) Iterate through the given list using a for loop, stopping at the second-to-last item to avoid an index out of range error.
4) In each iteration, create a tuple of the current item and the next item in the list.
5) Append the created tuple to the list of pairs.
6) After the loop, return the list of pairs.

Code:
```python
def pair_wise(lst):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the pairs
    pairs = []
    # Iterate through the list, stopping at the second-to-last item
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        # Create a tuple of the current item and the next item
        pair = (lst[i], lst[i + 1])
        # Append the tuple to the list of pairs
        pairs.append(pair)
    # Return the list of pairs
    return pairs
```
