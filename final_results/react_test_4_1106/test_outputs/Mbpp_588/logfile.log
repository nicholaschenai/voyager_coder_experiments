INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/588 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a python function to find the difference between largest and smallest value in a given list.
assert big_diff([1,2,3,4]) == 3
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/588 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the difference between the largest and smallest values in a given list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function named `big_diff` that takes a list as an argument.

2. **Find the Maximum Value**: Use the built-in `max()` function to find the largest value in the list.

3. **Find the Minimum Value**: Use the built-in `min()` function to find the smallest value in the list.

4. **Calculate the Difference**: Subtract the smallest value from the largest value to get the difference.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the calculated difference.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def big_diff(nums):
    return max(nums) - min(nums)

# Example usage
assert big_diff([1, 2, 3, 4]) == 3
```

In this implementation, the function `big_diff` takes a list `nums`, computes the maximum and minimum values, and returns their difference. The assertion checks that the function works correctly for the provided example.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/588 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan to implement the function `big_diff` which finds the difference between the largest and smallest values in a given list. The steps outlined are appropriate for the task and will lead to a solution that passes the assertion.

Plan:
1) Define the function `big_diff` that takes a single argument, a list of numbers.
2) Use the `max()` function to find the maximum value in the list.
3) Use the `min()` function to find the minimum value in the list.
4) Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum values.
5) Return the calculated difference.

Code:
```python
def big_diff(nums):
    # Find the maximum and minimum values in the list
    max_value = max(nums)
    min_value = min(nums)
    
    # Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum values
