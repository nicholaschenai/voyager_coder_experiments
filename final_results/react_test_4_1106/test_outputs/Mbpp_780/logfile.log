INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/780 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding combinations of sums with tuples in a given list of tuples in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand the Input and Output**: The input is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The output should be a list of tuples, where each tuple represents the sum of the corresponding elements from two different input tuples.

2. **Iterate Over the Tuples**: You will need to use nested loops to iterate over each pair of tuples in the list. This means for each tuple, you will pair it with every other tuple (including itself if needed).

3. **Calculate the Sums**: For each pair of tuples, calculate the sum of the first elements and the sum of the second elements. This can be done by accessing the elements of the tuples using indexing.

4. **Store the Results**: As you calculate the sums, store the resulting tuples in a list. Ensure that you avoid duplicates if necessary, depending on the requirements.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the list of tuples containing the sums.

Here is a high-level outline of what the function might look like:

```python
def find_combinations(tuple_list):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(tuple_list)):
        for j in range(len(tuple_list)):
            sum_first = tuple_list[i][0] + tuple_list[j][0]
            sum_second = tuple_list[i][1] + tuple_list[j][1]
            result.append((sum_first, sum_second))
    return result
```

6. **Testing the Function**: Use assertions to test the function against expected outputs to ensure it behaves as intended.

By following these steps, you can create a function that computes the combinations of sums from a list of tuples.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/780 [generation text] Explain: The context provided a rough plan that is mostly correct, but it does not account for avoiding duplicates in the result list. The task requires finding combinations, which implies that each pair should be considered only once. Therefore, the inner loop should start from the current index of the outer loop to avoid considering the same pair twice.

Plan:
1) Define the function `find_combinations` that takes a list of tuples as an argument.
2) Initialize an empty list to store the result.
3) Use a nested loop to iterate over the list of tuples. The inner loop should start from the current index of the outer loop to avoid duplicates.
4) For each pair of tuples, calculate the sum of the first elements and the sum of the second elements.

You are a Python programming assistant that assesses my progress of Python programming and provides useful guidance.

I will give you the following information:

[Task]: The objective I need to accomplish.
[Context]: The context of the task. Serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help me on the task, but my priority is to follow instructions in the Task tag.
[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

You should only respond in JSON format as described below:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

1. **Understand the Input and Output**: The input is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The output should be a list of tuples, where each tuple represents the sum of the corresponding elements from two different input tuples.

2. **Iterate Over the Tuples**: You will need to use nested loops to iterate over each pair of tuples in the list. This means for each tuple, you will pair it with every other tuple (including itself if needed).

3. **Calculate the Sums**: For each pair of tuples, calculate the sum of the first elements and the sum of the second elements. This can be done by accessing the elements of the tuples using indexing.

4. **Store the Results**: As you calculate the sums, store the resulting tuples in a list. Ensure that you avoid duplicates if necessary, depending on the requirements.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the list of tuples containing the sums.

Here is a high-level outline of what the function might look like:

```python
def find_combinations(tuple_list):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(tuple_list)):
        for j in range(len(tuple_list)):
            sum_first = tuple_list[i][0] + tuple_list[j][0]
            sum_second = tuple_list[i][1] + tuple_list[j][1]
            result.append((sum_first, sum_second))
    return result
```

6. **Testing the Function**: Use assertions to test the function against expected outputs to ensure it behaves as intended.

By following these steps, you can create a function that computes the combinations of sums from a list of tuples.


[Critique]
The function should only combine each tuple with every other tuple, not with itself, and it should not include duplicate combinations. To fix this, the inner loop should start from i + 1 instead of i, and the function should check for duplicates before appending to the result list. Alternatively, if duplicates are allowed but self-combinations are not, the inner loop should still start from i + 1, but no duplicate check is needed.


INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/780 [generation text] Explain: The provided code includes combinations of tuples with themselves and also includes duplicate combinations. The task requires that each tuple should only be combined with every other tuple, not with itself, and the combinations should not be duplicated.

Plan:
1) Modify the inner loop to start from `i + 1` instead of `i` to avoid combining a tuple with itself and to avoid duplicate combinations.
2) Calculate the sums of the first and second elements of the tuples for each unique pair.
3) Append the resulting tuple to the result list.
4) Return the result list after all unique combinations have been processed.

Code:
```python
def find_combinations(tuple_list):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(tuple_list)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(tuple_list)):
            sum_first = tuple_list[i][0] + tuple_list[j][0]
            sum_second = tuple_list[i][1] + tuple_list[j][1]
            result.append((sum_first, sum_second))
    return result
