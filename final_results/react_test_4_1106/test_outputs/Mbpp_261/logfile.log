"""
Write a function that takes in two tuples and performs mathematical division operation element-wise across the given tuples.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/261 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of performing element-wise division on two tuples in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `division_elements` that takes two tuples as parameters.

2. **Check Tuple Lengths**: Ensure that both tuples have the same length. If they do not, you may want to raise an error or handle it appropriately.

3. **Iterate Over Elements**: Use a loop (like a `for` loop) to iterate over the indices of the tuples. For each index, retrieve the corresponding elements from both tuples.

4. **Perform Division**: For each pair of elements, perform the division operation. Make sure to handle any potential division by zero errors.

5. **Store Results**: Collect the results of the division in a new tuple.

6. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the new tuple containing the results of the element-wise division.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def division_elements(tuple1, tuple2):
    if len(tuple1) != len(tuple2):
        raise ValueError("Tuples must be of the same length")
    
    result = []
    for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2):
        if b == 0:
            raise ValueError("Division by zero is not allowed")
        result.append(a // b)  # Use integer division
    
    return tuple(result)
```

In this example, `zip` is used to pair elements from both tuples, and `//` is used for integer division. The function checks for division by zero and raises an error if encountered. Finally, it returns the result as a tuple.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/261 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct, but it uses integer division (`//`) instead of true division (`/`). The task specifies a mathematical division operation, which implies true division. Therefore, we should use the `/` operator instead of `//`. Additionally, the plan does not mention converting the result list back to a tuple before returning, which is necessary to match the expected output format.

Plan:
1) Define the function `division_elements` that takes two tuples as arguments.
2) Check if both tuples have the same length. If not, raise a `ValueError`.
3) Use the `zip` function to iterate over pairs of elements from both tuples simultaneously.
4) For each pair, perform true division and handle division by zero by raising a `ValueError`.
5) Collect the results of the division in a list.
6) Convert the list of results into a tuple.
7) Return the resulting tuple.

Code:
```python
def division_elements(tuple1, tuple2):
    # Check if both tuples have the same length
    if len(tuple1) != len(tuple2):
