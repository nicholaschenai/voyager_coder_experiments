INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/778 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of packing consecutive duplicates of a given list into sublists in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Initialize Variables**: Start by creating an empty list to hold the final result and a temporary list to collect consecutive duplicates.

2. **Iterate Through the List**: Loop through each element in the input list. For each element, check if it is the same as the previous one.

3. **Collect Duplicates**: If the current element is the same as the previous one, append it to the temporary list. If it is different, check if the temporary list is not empty. If it contains elements, append it to the result list and then start a new temporary list with the current element.

4. **Handle the Last Group**: After the loop, make sure to check if there are any remaining elements in the temporary list and append it to the result list.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the list that contains all the sublists of consecutive duplicates.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def pack_consecutive_duplicates(input_list):
    if not input_list:  # Handle empty list case
        return []
    
    result = []
    temp = [input_list[0]]  # Start with the first element

    for i in range(1, len(input_list)):
        if input_list[i] == input_list[i - 1]:
            temp.append(input_list[i])  # Collect duplicates
        else:
            result.append(temp)  # Append the collected duplicates to result
            temp = [input_list[i]]  # Start a new group

    result.append(temp)  # Append the last group
    return result
```

This function will correctly pack consecutive duplicates into sublists as specified in the assertion.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/778 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a rough plan that seems to be correct for accomplishing the task. It outlines the steps needed to write a function that packs consecutive duplicates of list elements into sublists. The plan includes handling the edge case of an empty list, iterating through the list to collect duplicates, and ensuring the last group of elements is added to the result.

Plan:
1) Define the function `pack_consecutive_duplicates` that takes a list as an argument.
2) Check if the input list is empty. If it is, return an empty list.
3) Initialize a result list to hold the sublists and a temporary list with the first element of the input list.
4) Iterate through the input list starting from the second element.
5) Compare each element with the previous one. If they are the same, append the element to the temporary list.
6) If the current element is different from the previous one, append the temporary list to the result list and start a new temporary list with the current element.
7) After the loop, append the last temporary list to the result list.
8) Return the result list.

Code:
```python
def pack_consecutive_duplicates(input_list):
    # Handle empty list case
    if not input_list:
        return []
    
    # Initialize the result list and the temporary list
    result = []
    temp = [input_list[0]]

    # Iterate through the input list
    for i in range(1, len(input_list)):
        if input_list[i] == input_list[i - 1]:
            # Collect duplicates
            temp.append(input_list[i])
        else:
            # Append the collected duplicates to result
            result.append(temp)
            # Start a new group with the current element
            temp = [input_list[i]]

    # Append the last group
    result.append(temp)
    return result
```
