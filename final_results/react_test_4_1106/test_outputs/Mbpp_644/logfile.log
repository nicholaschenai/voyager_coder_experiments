"""
Write a python function to reverse an array upto a given position.
assert reverse_Array_Upto_K([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],4) == [4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 6]
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/644 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of reversing an array up to a given position in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `reverse_Array_Upto_K` that takes two parameters: the array (list) and the position `k`.

2. **Slice the Array**: Use slicing to separate the part of the array that needs to be reversed (from the start of the array up to position `k`) and the part that remains unchanged (from position `k` to the end of the array).

3. **Reverse the Sliced Part**: Reverse the sliced part of the array using Python's slicing feature or the `reverse()` method.

4. **Combine the Parts**: Concatenate the reversed part with the unchanged part to form the final array.

5. **Return the Result**: Return the newly formed array.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def reverse_Array_Upto_K(arr, k):
    # Step 1: Slice the array up to k and reverse it
    reversed_part = arr[:k][::-1]  # Reverse the first k elements
    unchanged_part = arr[k:]        # Get the rest of the array
    # Step 2: Combine the reversed part with the unchanged part
    return reversed_part + unchanged_part
```

This function will reverse the elements of the array up to the specified position `k` and return the modified array. The assertion provided in the question can be used to test the function.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of reversing an array up to a given position in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `reverse_Array_Upto_K` that takes two parameters: the array (list) and the position `k`.

2. **Slice the Array**: Use slicing to separate the part of the array that needs to be reversed (from the start of the array up to position `k`) and the part that remains unchanged (from position `k` to the end of the array).

3. **Reverse the Sliced Part**: Reverse the sliced part of the array using Python's slicing feature or the `reverse()` method.

4. **Combine the Parts**: Concatenate the reversed part with the unchanged part to form the final array.

5. **Return the Result**: Return the newly formed array.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def reverse_Array_Upto_K(arr, k):
    # Step 1: Slice the array up to k and reverse it
    reversed_part = arr[:k][::-1]  # Reverse the first k elements
    unchanged_part = arr[k:]        # Get the rest of the array
    # Step 2: Combine the reversed part with the unchanged part
    return reversed_part + unchanged_part
```

This function will reverse the elements of the array up to the specified position `k` and return the modified array. The assertion provided in the question can be used to test the function.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/644 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a good starting point for the task. However, there is a slight mistake in the plan provided in the context. The slicing should be done up to `k` but not including `k` (since array indices start from 0 in Python). Therefore, we need to slice the array up to `k-1` to include the `k`th element in the reversed part.

Plan:
1) Define the function `reverse_Array_Upto_K` with parameters `arr` (the array to be reversed) and `k` (the position up to which the array should be reversed).
2) Slice the array from the start up to `k` (not including `k`) and reverse this part.
3) Slice the array from `k` to the end, which will remain unchanged.
4) Concatenate the reversed part with the unchanged part.
5) Return the concatenated array.

Code:
```python
def reverse_Array_Upto_K(arr, k):
    # Step 1: Slice the array up to k (not including k) and reverse it
    reversed_part = arr[:k][::-1]  # Reverse the first k elements
    # Step 2: Get the rest of the array from k to the end
