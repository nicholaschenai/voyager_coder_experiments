INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/623 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of computing the n-th power of each number in a list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes two parameters: a list of numbers and the exponent `n`.

2. **Iterate Over the List**: Use a loop (like a list comprehension or a for loop) to iterate over each number in the input list.

3. **Compute the Power**: For each number, compute its n-th power using the exponentiation operator `**`.

4. **Collect Results**: Store the results in a new list.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the new list containing the n-th powers of the original numbers.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def nth_nums(numbers, n):
    return [x ** n for x in numbers]
```

In this example, `x ** n` computes the n-th power of each number `x` in the list `numbers`. The list comprehension collects all the results into a new list, which is then returned.

You can then use the `assert` statement to verify that the function works as expected by comparing the output of the function with the expected result.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

Answer: To accomplish the task of computing the n-th power of each number in a list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes two parameters: a list of numbers and the exponent `n`.

2. **Iterate Over the List**: Use a loop (like a list comprehension or a for loop) to iterate over each number in the input list.

3. **Compute the Power**: For each number, compute its n-th power using the exponentiation operator `**`.

4. **Collect Results**: Store the results in a new list.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the new list containing the n-th powers of the original numbers.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def nth_nums(numbers, n):
    return [x ** n for x in numbers]
```

In this example, `x ** n` computes the n-th power of each number `x` in the list `numbers`. The list comprehension collects all the results into a new list, which is then returned.

You can then use the `assert` statement to verify that the function works as expected by comparing the output of the function with the expected result.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/623 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan to accomplish the task. The steps outlined are appropriate for writing a function that computes the n-th power of each number in a list.

Plan:
1) Define a function named `nth_nums` that takes two parameters: a list of numbers (`numbers`) and an integer `n` representing the exponent.
2) Use a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the `numbers` list.
3) For each number in the list, compute its n-th power using the exponentiation operator `**`.
4) Return the new list containing the n-th powers of the original numbers.

Code:
```python
def nth_nums(numbers, n):
    return [x ** n for x in numbers]

This function should pass the assertion provided in the task when executed.
