INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/77 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a python function to find whether a number is divisible by 11.
assert is_Diff (12345) == False
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/77 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of writing a Python function that checks if a number is divisible by 11, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function named `is_Diff` that takes a single argument (the number you want to check).

2. **Check Divisibility**: Inside the function, use the modulus operator `%` to determine if the number is divisible by 11. A number is divisible by 11 if the remainder when divided by 11 is zero.

3. **Return the Result**: The function should return `True` if the number is divisible by 11 and `False` otherwise.

4. **Use Assertions**: After defining the function, you can use an assertion to test the function with the provided example. The assertion checks if the function returns `False` for the input `12345`, which is not divisible by 11.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def is_Diff(number):
    return number % 11 == 0

# Example assertion
assert is_Diff(12345) == False
```

In this example, `is_Diff(12345)` will return `False` because 12345 is not divisible by 11, which satisfies the assertion.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

Answer: To accomplish the task of writing a Python function that checks if a number is divisible by 11, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function named `is_Diff` that takes a single argument (the number you want to check).

2. **Check Divisibility**: Inside the function, use the modulus operator `%` to determine if the number is divisible by 11. A number is divisible by 11 if the remainder when divided by 11 is zero.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def is_Diff(number):
    return number % 11 == 0

# Example assertion
assert is_Diff(12345) == False
```

In this example, `is_Diff(12345)` will return `False` because 12345 is not divisible by 11, which satisfies the assertion.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/77 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan to accomplish the task. The function name `is_Diff` is specified, and the function should check if a number is divisible by 11. The modulus operator `%` can be used to determine divisibility by checking if the remainder is zero.

Plan:
1) Define the function `is_Diff` with one parameter, `number`.
2) Inside the function, use the modulus operator `%` to check if `number` is divisible by 11.
3) Return `True` if the remainder is 0 (indicating divisibility), otherwise return `False`.

def is_Diff(number):
    # Check if the number is divisible by 11
