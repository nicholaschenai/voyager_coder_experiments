INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/161 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to remove all elements from a given list present in another list.
assert remove_elements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], [2, 4, 6, 8]) == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/161 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of removing all elements from a given list that are present in another list, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `remove_elements` that takes two parameters: the first list (the one from which elements will be removed) and the second list (the list of elements to be removed).

2. **Iterate Through the First List**: Use a loop or a list comprehension to iterate through each element in the first list.

3. **Check for Existence**: For each element in the first list, check if it exists in the second list (the list of elements to be removed).

4. **Build a New List**: If an element from the first list is not found in the second list, add it to a new list.

5. **Return the New List**: After iterating through all elements, return the new list that contains only the elements that were not removed.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps in Python:

```python
def remove_elements(list1, list2):
    return [element for element in list1 if element not in list2]
```

In this implementation, a list comprehension is used to create a new list that includes only those elements from `list1` that are not present in `list2`. The `assert` statement can then be used to verify that the function works as expected.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of removing all elements from a given list that are present in another list, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `remove_elements` that takes two parameters: the first list (the one from which elements will be removed) and the second list (the list of elements to be removed).

2. **Iterate Through the First List**: Use a loop or a list comprehension to iterate through each element in the first list.

3. **Check for Existence**: For each element in the first list, check if it exists in the second list (the list of elements to be removed).

4. **Build a New List**: If an element from the first list is not found in the second list, add it to a new list.

5. **Return the New List**: After iterating through all elements, return the new list that contains only the elements that were not removed.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps in Python:

```python
def remove_elements(list1, list2):
    return [element for element in list1 if element not in list2]
```

In this implementation, a list comprehension is used to create a new list that includes only those elements from `list1` that are not present in `list2`. The `assert` statement can then be used to verify that the function works as expected.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/161 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan to accomplish the task. The steps outlined are appropriate for creating a function that removes elements from one list that are present in another list.

Plan:
1) Define the function `remove_elements` with two parameters: `list1` and `list2`.
2) Use a list comprehension to iterate through `list1` and include only those elements that are not in `list2`.
3) Return the new list created by the list comprehension.

Code:
