"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/456 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of reversing each string in a given list of string values in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a list of strings as an argument.

2. **Iterate Over the List**: Use a loop to iterate over each string in the list.

3. **Reverse Each String**: For each string, you can reverse it. In Python, you can reverse a string using slicing. The syntax `string[::-1]` will give you the reversed version of `string`.

4. **Collect the Results**: Store the reversed strings in a new list.

5. **Return the New List**: Finally, return the new list containing all the reversed strings.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def reverse_string_list(string_list):
    reversed_list = []  # Step 4: Initialize an empty list to hold reversed strings
    for string in string_list:  # Step 2: Iterate over each string in the input list
        reversed_list.append(string[::-1])  # Step 3: Reverse the string and add to the new list
    return reversed_list  # Step 5: Return the list of reversed strings
```

You can then use the `assert` statement to check if the function works as expected, as shown in your example.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of reversing each string in a given list of string values in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a list of strings as an argument.

2. **Iterate Over the List**: Use a loop to iterate over each string in the list.

3. **Reverse Each String**: For each string, you can reverse it. In Python, you can reverse a string using slicing. The syntax `string[::-1]` will give you the reversed version of `string`.

4. **Collect the Results**: Store the reversed strings in a new list.

5. **Return the New List**: Finally, return the new list containing all the reversed strings.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def reverse_string_list(string_list):
    reversed_list = []  # Step 4: Initialize an empty list to hold reversed strings
    for string in string_list:  # Step 2: Iterate over each string in the input list
        reversed_list.append(string[::-1])  # Step 3: Reverse the string and add to the new list
    return reversed_list  # Step 5: Return the list of reversed strings
```

You can then use the `assert` statement to check if the function works as expected, as shown in your example.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/456 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan to accomplish the task. It outlines the steps needed to create a function that reverses each string in a given list of strings. The slicing method `string[::-1]` is a valid approach to reverse a string in Python.

Plan:
1) Define the function `reverse_string_list` that takes one argument, `string_list`, which is a list of strings.
2) Initialize an empty list `reversed_list` to store the reversed strings.
3) Iterate over each string in the `string_list`.
4) Reverse each string using slicing (`string[::-1]`) and append it to `reversed_list`.
5) Return the `reversed_list` after the loop ends.

Code:
```python
def reverse_string_list(string_list):
    reversed_list = []  # Initialize an empty list to hold reversed strings
    for string in string_list:  # Iterate over each string in the input list
        reversed_list.append(string[::-1])  # Reverse the string and add to the new list
    return reversed_list  # Return the list of reversed strings
```
