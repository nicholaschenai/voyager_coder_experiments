Write a function to find tuples which have all elements divisible by k from the given list of tuples.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/75 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding tuples where all elements are divisible by a given integer `k`, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function named `find_tuples` that takes two parameters: a list of tuples and an integer `k`.

2. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to iterate through each tuple in the provided list.

3. **Check Divisibility**: For each tuple, check if all its elements are divisible by `k`. This can be done using the `all()` function combined with a generator expression that checks the condition for each element in the tuple.

4. **Collect Results**: If a tuple meets the condition (i.e., all its elements are divisible by `k`), add it to a results list.

5. **Return the Results**: Finally, return the list of tuples that satisfy the condition.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def find_tuples(tuples_list, k):
    result = []
    for tup in tuples_list:
        if all(element % k == 0 for element in tup):
            result.append(tup)
    return result
```

In this function:
- `tuples_list` is the input list of tuples.
- `k` is the divisor.
- The `all()` function checks if the condition `element % k == 0` holds true for every element in the tuple.

This approach efficiently filters the tuples based on the divisibility condition.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding tuples where all elements are divisible by a given integer `k`, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function named `find_tuples` that takes two parameters: a list of tuples and an integer `k`.

2. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to iterate through each tuple in the provided list.

3. **Check Divisibility**: For each tuple, check if all its elements are divisible by `k`. This can be done using the `all()` function combined with a generator expression that checks the condition for each element in the tuple.

4. **Collect Results**: If a tuple meets the condition (i.e., all its elements are divisible by `k`), add it to a results list.

5. **Return the Results**: Finally, return the list of tuples that satisfy the condition.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def find_tuples(tuples_list, k):
    result = []
    for tup in tuples_list:
        if all(element % k == 0 for element in tup):
            result.append(tup)
    return result
```

In this function:
- `tuples_list` is the input list of tuples.
- `k` is the divisor.
- The `all()` function checks if the condition `element % k == 0` holds true for every element in the tuple.

This approach efficiently filters the tuples based on the divisibility condition.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/75 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan to accomplish the task. The steps outlined are appropriate for creating a function that filters tuples based on the divisibility of their elements by a given number `k`.

Plan:
1) Define the function `find_tuples` with two parameters: `tuples_list` (a list of tuples) and `k` (an integer).
2) Initialize an empty list `result` to store tuples that meet the condition.
3) Iterate through each tuple in `tuples_list`.
4) Use the `all()` function with a generator expression to check if all elements in the current tuple are divisible by `k`.
5) If the condition is met, append the tuple to the `result` list.
6) After iterating through all tuples, return the `result` list.

Code:
```python
def find_tuples(tuples_list, k):
    result = []
    for tup in tuples_list:
        if all(element % k == 0 for element in tup):
            result.append(tup)
    return result
```

This function will return a list of tuples where each element in the tuple is divisible by the given integer `k`.
