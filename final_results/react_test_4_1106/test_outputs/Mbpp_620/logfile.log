"""
Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
assert largest_subset([ 1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18 ]) == 4
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/620 [generation text] Answer: To solve the problem of finding the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair in the subset is divisible, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understanding Divisibility**: For a pair of numbers (a, b) to be divisible, either a % b == 0 or b % a == 0 must hold true. This means that one number must be a multiple of the other.

2. **Sorting the List**: Start by sorting the list of numbers. This helps in efficiently checking divisibility since if a number is divisible by another, it will appear later in the sorted list.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: Use a dynamic programming (DP) approach to keep track of the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with each number in the sorted list. Create a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with the number at index `i`.

4. **Filling the DP Array**: For each number in the sorted list, check all previous numbers to see if they can form a divisible pair. If `numbers[j]` is divisible by `numbers[i]`, then you can potentially extend the subset ending at `j` to include `i`. Update `dp[i]` accordingly.

5. **Finding the Maximum**: The result will be the maximum value in the DP array, which represents the size of the largest subset found.

Here is a high-level outline of the function:

```python
def largest_subset(numbers):
    numbers.sort()  # Step 2: Sort the list
    n = len(numbers)
    dp = [1] * n  # Step 3: Initialize DP array

    # Step 4: Fill the DP array
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            if numbers[i] % numbers[j] == 0:  # Check divisibility
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)

    # Step 5: Return the maximum size found
    return max(dp)
```

This function will correctly compute the size of the largest subset where every pair is divisible, as demonstrated by the provided assertion.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/620 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a rough plan that seems to be correct for solving the task. It outlines a dynamic programming approach to find the largest subset of numbers where every pair is divisible. The steps include sorting the list, initializing a DP array, filling the DP array by checking divisibility, and finally returning the maximum size found in the DP array.

Plan:
1) Define the function `largest_subset` that takes a list of numbers as an argument.
2) Sort the list of numbers to ensure that if a number is divisible by another, it will appear later in the sorted list.
3) Initialize a DP array with the same length as the sorted list, with all elements set to 1. This array will keep track of the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with each number in the sorted list.
4) Iterate over the sorted list, and for each number, iterate over all previous numbers to check if they form a divisible pair (i.e., if the current number is divisible by the previous number).
5) If a divisible pair is found, update the DP array at the current index to be the maximum of its current value or the value at the previous index plus one.
6) After filling the DP array, return the maximum value from the DP array, which represents the size of the largest divisible subset.

Code:
```python
def largest_subset(numbers):
    # Step 2: Sort the list
    numbers.sort()
    n = len(numbers)
    # Step 3: Initialize DP array
    dp = [1] * n

    # Step 4: Fill the DP array
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            if numbers[i] % numbers[j] == 0:  # Check divisibility
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)

    # Step 5: Return the maximum size found
    return max(dp)
```

This function should pass the assertion provided in the task.
