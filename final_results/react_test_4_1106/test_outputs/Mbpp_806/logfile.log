INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/806 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to find maximum run of uppercase characters in the given string.
assert max_run_uppercase('GeMKSForGERksISBESt') == 5
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/806 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the maximum run of uppercase characters in a given string, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Initialize Variables**: Start by initializing two variables: one to keep track of the current run of uppercase characters and another to store the maximum run found so far.

2. **Iterate Through the String**: Loop through each character in the string. For each character, check if it is an uppercase letter.

3. **Count Runs**: If the character is uppercase, increment the current run counter. If it is not uppercase, compare the current run counter with the maximum run counter and update the maximum if necessary. Then, reset the current run counter to zero.

4. **Final Check**: After the loop, perform a final check to ensure that if the string ends with an uppercase run, it is considered for the maximum run.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the maximum run of uppercase characters found.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic in Python:

```python
def max_run_uppercase(s):
    max_run = 0
    current_run = 0
    
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            current_run += 1
        else:
            max_run = max(max_run, current_run)
            current_run = 0
            
    # Final check in case the string ends with an uppercase run
    max_run = max(max_run, current_run)
    
    return max_run

# Example usage
assert max_run_uppercase('GeMKSForGERksISBESt') == 5
```

This function will correctly find the maximum run of uppercase characters in the provided string.

Here are some useful functions written earlier which you can reuse or reference.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/806 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan to solve the task. The steps outlined are appropriate for finding the maximum run of uppercase characters in a given string.

Plan:
1) Define the function `max_run_uppercase` that takes a single argument, a string `s`.
2) Initialize two variables, `max_run` and `current_run`, to zero. `max_run` will keep track of the maximum run of uppercase characters found so far, and `current_run` will keep track of the current run of consecutive uppercase characters.
3) Iterate over each character in the string `s`.
4) For each character, check if it is an uppercase character using the `isupper()` method.
5) If the character is uppercase, increment `current_run` by 1.
6) If the character is not uppercase, update `max_run` with the maximum of `max_run` and `current_run`, and reset `current_run` to zero.
7) After the loop, perform a final check to update `max_run` with the maximum of `max_run` and `current_run` in case the string ends with an uppercase run.
8) Return the value of `max_run`.

Code:
```python
def max_run_uppercase(s):
    max_run = 0
    current_run = 0
    
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
