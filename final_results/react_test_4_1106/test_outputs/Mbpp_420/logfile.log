INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/420 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a python function to find the cube sum of first n even natural numbers.
assert cube_Sum(2) == 72
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/420 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand Even Natural Numbers**: The first n even natural numbers are 2, 4, 6, ..., up to 2n. Each of these numbers can be represented as `2 * i` where `i` ranges from 1 to n.

2. **Calculate the Cube**: For each even number, you need to calculate its cube. The cube of a number `x` is calculated as `x ** 3`.

3. **Sum the Cubes**: You will need to maintain a running total of the cubes of these even numbers. This can be done using a loop that iterates from 1 to n, calculating the cube of each even number and adding it to a cumulative sum.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, the function should return the total sum of the cubes.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def cube_Sum(n):
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        even_number = 2 * i
        total_sum += even_number ** 3
    return total_sum
```

In this function:
- We initialize `total_sum` to 0.
- We loop from 1 to n, calculate the even number, cube it, and add it to `total_sum`.
- Finally, we return `total_sum`.

The assertion `assert cube_Sum(2) == 72` checks that the function works correctly for the input `n = 2`, which corresponds to the even numbers 2 and 4, whose cubes sum to 72 (2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72).

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand Even Natural Numbers**: The first n even natural numbers are 2, 4, 6, ..., up to 2n. Each of these numbers can be represented as `2 * i` where `i` ranges from 1 to n.

2. **Calculate the Cube**: For each even number, you need to calculate its cube. The cube of a number `x` is calculated as `x ** 3`.

3. **Sum the Cubes**: You will need to maintain a running total of the cubes of these even numbers. This can be done using a loop that iterates from 1 to n, calculating the cube of each even number and adding it to a cumulative sum.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, the function should return the total sum of the cubes.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def cube_Sum(n):
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        even_number = 2 * i
        total_sum += even_number ** 3
    return total_sum
```

In this function:
- We initialize `total_sum` to 0.
- We loop from 1 to n, calculate the even number, cube it, and add it to `total_sum`.
- Finally, we return `total_sum`.

The assertion `assert cube_Sum(2) == 72` checks that the function works correctly for the input `n = 2`, which corresponds to the even numbers 2 and 4, whose cubes sum to 72 (2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72).

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/420 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan to solve the task. The function needs to calculate the sum of cubes of the first n even natural numbers. The even natural numbers can be generated by multiplying each number from 1 to n by 2, and their cubes can be calculated by raising them to the power of 3. The sum of these cubes should be returned by the function.

Plan:
1) Define the function `cube_Sum` that takes one argument, `n`.
2) Initialize a variable `total_sum` to 0 to keep track of the cumulative sum of cubes.
3) Use a for loop to iterate over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
4) In each iteration, calculate the even number as `2 * i` where `i` is the current number in the loop.
5) Calculate the cube of the even number and add it to `total_sum`.
6) After the loop, return `total_sum`.

Code:
```python
def cube_Sum(n):
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        even_number = 2 * i
        total_sum += even_number ** 3
