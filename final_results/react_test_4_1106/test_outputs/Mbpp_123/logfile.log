Write a function to sum all amicable numbers from 1 to a specified number.
assert amicable_numbers_sum(999)==504
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/123 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of summing all amicable numbers from 1 to a specified number in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand Amicable Numbers**: Amicable numbers are two different numbers where the sum of the proper divisors (excluding the number itself) of each number equals the other number. For example, the pair (220, 284) is amicable because the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284, and the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220.

2. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `amicable_numbers_sum` that takes a single argument, the upper limit (specified number).

3. **Find Proper Divisors**: Write a helper function to calculate the sum of proper divisors of a number. This can be done by iterating through possible divisors and summing those that divide the number evenly.

4. **Check for Amicable Pairs**: Loop through numbers from 1 to the specified number. For each number, calculate its sum of proper divisors. Then check if the sum of proper divisors of that sum equals the original number, and ensure that the two numbers are different.

5. **Sum Unique Amicable Numbers**: Maintain a set to store amicable numbers to avoid counting duplicates. If you find an amicable pair, add both numbers to the set.

6. **Return the Sum**: Finally, return the sum of all unique amicable numbers found in the specified range.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def sum_of_proper_divisors(n):
    # Calculate the sum of proper divisors of n
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            total += i
    return total

def amicable_numbers_sum(limit):
    amicable_numbers = set()
    
    for num in range(1, limit + 1):
        partner = sum_of_proper_divisors(num)
        if partner != num and partner <= limit:
            if sum_of_proper_divisors(partner) == num:
                amicable_numbers.add(num)
                amicable_numbers.add(partner)
    
    return sum(amicable_numbers)

# Example usage
assert amicable_numbers_sum(999) == 504
```

This code defines the necessary logic to find and sum amicable numbers up to a specified limit.

At each round of conversation, I will give you

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/123 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a rough plan to solve the task, which is correct. We need to find amicable numbers within a given range and sum them up. An amicable number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors equals another number, and the sum of the proper divisors of this second number equals the first number. The context also correctly suggests using a helper function to calculate the sum of proper divisors and a main function to find and sum the amicable numbers.

Plan:
1) Write a helper function `sum_of_proper_divisors` that calculates the sum of proper divisors of a given number.
2) Write the main function `amicable_numbers_sum` that takes an integer `limit` as an argument.
3) In the main function, iterate through numbers from 1 to `limit`.
4) For each number, calculate the sum of its proper divisors using the helper function.
5) Check if the sum of proper divisors of this sum equals the original number and that the two numbers are different.
6) If the conditions are met, add both numbers to a set to ensure uniqueness.
7) After the loop, return the sum of the set containing the amicable numbers.

Code:
```python
def sum_of_proper_divisors(n):
    # Calculate the sum of proper divisors of n
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            total += i
    return total

            amicable_numbers.add(num)
            amicable_numbers.add(partner)
    
    return sum(amicable_numbers)

# Example usage
assert amicable_numbers_sum(999) == 504
