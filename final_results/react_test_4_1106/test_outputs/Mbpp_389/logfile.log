"""
Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
assert find_lucas(9) == 76
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/389 [generation text] Answer: To find the n-th Lucas number in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand the Lucas Sequence**: The Lucas numbers are a sequence similar to the Fibonacci numbers, defined as follows:
   - L(0) = 2
   - L(1) = 1
   - L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

2. **Define a Function**: Create a function named `find_lucas` that takes an integer `n` as an argument.

3. **Base Cases**: Inside the function, handle the base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1` by returning 2 and 1, respectively.

4. **Recursive or Iterative Calculation**: For values of `n` greater than 1, you can either use a recursive approach (calling the function itself) or an iterative approach (using a loop) to calculate the n-th Lucas number based on the previous two numbers in the sequence.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the calculated Lucas number.

Here is a simple implementation using an iterative approach:

```python
def find_lucas(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 2, 1
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b

# Example usage
assert find_lucas(9) == 76
```

This function initializes the first two Lucas numbers and iteratively computes the subsequent numbers until it reaches the n-th number, which it then returns.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

    if n == 0:
        return 2

# Example usage

This function initializes the first two Lucas numbers and iteratively computes the subsequent numbers until it reaches the n-th number, which it then returns.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/389 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan to implement the `find_lucas` function. The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, with different starting values. The iterative approach is efficient for this task.

Plan:
1) Define the function `find_lucas` that takes an integer `n` as its parameter.
2) Handle the base cases: if `n` is 0, return 2; if `n` is 1, return 1.
3) For `n` greater than 1, use an iterative approach to calculate the n-th Lucas number. Initialize two variables to store the previous two Lucas numbers and update them in each iteration of the loop.
4) Return the n-th Lucas number after the loop completes.

Code:

def find_lucas(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
