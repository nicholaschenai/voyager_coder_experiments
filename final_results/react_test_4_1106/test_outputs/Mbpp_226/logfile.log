"""
Write a python function to remove the characters which have odd index values of a given string.
assert odd_values_string('abcdef') == 'ace'
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/226 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of removing characters with odd index values from a given string in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a string as an argument.

2. **Iterate Over the String**: Use a loop or a list comprehension to iterate over the characters of the string along with their indices.

3. **Check Index Values**: For each character, check if its index is even. In Python, you can use the modulus operator (`%`) to determine if an index is even (i.e., `index % 2 == 0`).

4. **Build a New String**: Collect the characters that have even indices into a new string. You can do this by appending the characters to a list and then joining them together at the end.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the new string that contains only the characters from the original string that had even indices.

Here is a conceptual example of how the function might look:

```python
def odd_values_string(s):
    return ''.join(s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 == 0)
```

In this example, `s[i]` retrieves the character at index `i`, and the list comprehension filters out characters based on the index condition. The `join` method is then used to concatenate the filtered characters into a single string.

The assertion `assert odd_values_string('abcdef') == 'ace'` checks that the function works as expected by comparing the output of the function with the expected result.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of removing characters with odd index values from a given string in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a string as an argument.

2. **Iterate Over the String**: Use a loop or a list comprehension to iterate over the characters of the string along with their indices.

3. **Check Index Values**: For each character, check if its index is even. In Python, you can use the modulus operator (`%`) to determine if an index is even (i.e., `index % 2 == 0`).

4. **Build a New String**: Collect the characters that have even indices into a new string. You can do this by appending the characters to a list and then joining them together at the end.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the new string that contains only the characters from the original string that had even indices.

Here is a conceptual example of how the function might look:

```python
def odd_values_string(s):
    return ''.join(s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 == 0)
```

In this example, `s[i]` retrieves the character at index `i`, and the list comprehension filters out characters based on the index condition. The `join` method is then used to concatenate the filtered characters into a single string.

The assertion `assert odd_values_string('abcdef') == 'ace'` checks that the function works as expected by comparing the output of the function with the expected result.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/226 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan to accomplish the task. The function needs to iterate over the string and collect characters that are at even indices (since indices start at 0, even indices correspond to odd positions in common 1-based counting). The provided conceptual example is a good starting point for the implementation.

Plan:
1) Define the function `odd_values_string` that takes a single argument `s`, which is the string from which we want to remove characters at odd indices.
2) Use a list comprehension to iterate over the string, selecting characters that are at even indices.
3) Join the selected characters into a new string.
4) Return the new string.

Code:
```python
def odd_values_string(s):
    # Use list comprehension to select characters at even indices
    return ''.join([s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 == 0])
