INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/102 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to convert a snake case string to camel case string.
assert snake_to_camel('python_program')=='PythonProgram'
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/102 [generation text] Answer: To convert a snake case string to a camel case string in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Split the String**: Use the `split()` method to break the snake case string into individual words. The delimiter for splitting will be the underscore (`_`).

2. **Capitalize Each Word**: Iterate through the list of words obtained from the split operation and capitalize the first letter of each word. You can use the `capitalize()` method for this purpose.

3. **Join the Words**: After capitalizing each word, use the `join()` method to concatenate the words back together without any spaces or underscores.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the newly formed camel case string.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps in a function:

```python
def snake_to_camel(snake_str):
    # Split the string by underscores
    words = snake_str.split('_')
    # Capitalize the first letter of each word and join them
    camel_case_str = ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words)
    return camel_case_str
```

With this function, calling `snake_to_camel('python_program')` will return `'PythonProgram'`, as expected.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/102 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan to convert a snake case string to camel case. The steps outlined are appropriate for the task at hand.

Plan:
1) Define the function `snake_to_camel` that takes a single argument, which is the snake case string.
2) Split the input string by underscores (`_`) to get a list of words.
3) Capitalize the first letter of each word in the list.
4) Join the capitalized words together without any spaces to form the camel case string.
5) Return the camel case string.

Code:
```python
def snake_to_camel(snake_str):
    # Split the string by underscores
    words = snake_str.split('_')
    # Capitalize the first letter of each word and join them
    camel_case_str = ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words)
