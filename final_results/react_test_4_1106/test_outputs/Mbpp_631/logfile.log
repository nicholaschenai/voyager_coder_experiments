INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/631 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to replace whitespaces with an underscore and vice versa in a given string.
assert replace_spaces('Jumanji The Jungle') == 'Jumanji_The_Jungle'
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/631 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of replacing whitespaces with underscores and vice versa in a given string, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a string as an argument.

2. **Iterate Through the String**: Use a loop to go through each character in the string.

3. **Check Each Character**: For each character, check if it is a whitespace or an underscore:
   - If it is a whitespace, replace it with an underscore.
   - If it is an underscore, replace it with a whitespace.
   - If it is neither, keep the character as it is.

4. **Build the Result**: You can use a list to collect the modified characters and then join them back into a single string.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the modified string.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic:

```python
def replace_spaces(input_string):
    result = []
    for char in input_string:
        if char == ' ':
            result.append('_')
        elif char == '_':
            result.append(' ')
        else:
            result.append(char)
    return ''.join(result)

# Example usage
assert replace_spaces('Jumanji The Jungle') == 'Jumanji_The_Jungle'
```

This function will replace all spaces with underscores and vice versa, as required.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of replacing whitespaces with underscores and vice versa in a given string, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a string as an argument.

2. **Iterate Through the String**: Use a loop to go through each character in the string.

3. **Check Each Character**: For each character, check if it is a whitespace or an underscore:
   - If it is a whitespace, replace it with an underscore.
   - If it is an underscore, replace it with a whitespace.
   - If it is neither, keep the character as it is.

4. **Build the Result**: You can use a list to collect the modified characters and then join them back into a single string.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the modified string.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic:

```python
def replace_spaces(input_string):
    result = []
    for char in input_string:
        if char == ' ':
            result.append('_')
        elif char == '_':
            result.append(' ')
        else:
            result.append(char)
    return ''.join(result)

# Example usage
assert replace_spaces('Jumanji The Jungle') == 'Jumanji_The_Jungle'
```

This function will replace all spaces with underscores and vice versa, as required.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/631 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan to accomplish the task. It outlines the steps needed to create a function that replaces whitespaces with underscores and vice versa in a given string. The provided code snippet is a good starting point and should work as expected.

Plan:
1) Define the function `replace_spaces` that takes a single argument, `input_string`, which is the string to be processed.
2) Iterate over each character in the `input_string`.
3) For each character, check if it is a whitespace or an underscore.
4) If it is a whitespace, replace it with an underscore.
5) If it is an underscore, replace it with a whitespace.
6) If it is neither, keep the character as it is.
7) Join the list of modified characters into a new string.
8) Return the new string.

Code:
```python
def replace_spaces(input_string):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the modified characters
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in input_string:
        # Replace whitespace with underscore
        if char == ' ':
            result.append('_')
        # Replace underscore with whitespace
        elif char == '_':

        else:
            result.append(char)
    
    # Join the list of characters into a new string and return it
