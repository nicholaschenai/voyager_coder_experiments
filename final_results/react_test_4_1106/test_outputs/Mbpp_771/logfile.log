"""
Write a function to check if the given expression is balanced or not. 
assert check_expression("{()}[{}]") == True
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/771 [generation text] Answer: To check if a given expression is balanced in terms of parentheses, brackets, and braces, you can use a stack data structure. The basic idea is to iterate through each character in the expression and perform the following steps:

1. **Initialize a Stack**: Create an empty stack to keep track of opening symbols.

2. **Iterate Through the Expression**: Loop through each character in the input string.

3. **Push Opening Symbols**: If the character is an opening symbol (i.e., '(', '{', or '['), push it onto the stack.

4. **Check Closing Symbols**: If the character is a closing symbol (i.e., ')', '}', or ']'):
   - Check if the stack is empty. If it is, this means there is no corresponding opening symbol, and the expression is unbalanced.
   - If the stack is not empty, pop the top element from the stack and check if it matches the current closing symbol. For example, if the current character is ')', the popped element should be '('. If they do not match, the expression is unbalanced.

5. **Final Check**: After processing all characters, check if the stack is empty. If it is empty, the expression is balanced; otherwise, it is unbalanced.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def check_expression(expression):
    stack = []
    matching_brackets = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}
    
    for char in expression:
        if char in matching_brackets.values():  # If it's an opening bracket
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in matching_brackets.keys():  # If it's a closing bracket
            if not stack or stack.pop() != matching_brackets[char]:
                return False  # Unbalanced
    return len(stack) == 0  # Balanced if stack is empty
```

This function will return `True` if the expression is balanced and `False` otherwise.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To check if a given expression is balanced in terms of parentheses, brackets, and braces, you can use a stack data structure. The basic idea is to iterate through each character in the expression and perform the following steps:

1. **Initialize a Stack**: Create an empty stack to keep track of opening symbols.

2. **Iterate Through the Expression**: Loop through each character in the input string.

3. **Push Opening Symbols**: If the character is an opening symbol (i.e., '(', '{', or '['), push it onto the stack.

4. **Check Closing Symbols**: If the character is a closing symbol (i.e., ')', '}', or ']'):
   - Check if the stack is empty. If it is, this means there is no corresponding opening symbol, and the expression is unbalanced.
   - If the stack is not empty, pop the top element from the stack and check if it matches the current closing symbol. For example, if the current character is ')', the popped element should be '('. If they do not match, the expression is unbalanced.

5. **Final Check**: After processing all characters, check if the stack is empty. If it is empty, the expression is balanced; otherwise, it is unbalanced.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def check_expression(expression):
    stack = []
    matching_brackets = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}
    
    for char in expression:
        if char in matching_brackets.values():  # If it's an opening bracket
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in matching_brackets.keys():  # If it's a closing bracket
            if not stack or stack.pop() != matching_brackets[char]:
                return False  # Unbalanced
    return len(stack) == 0  # Balanced if stack is empty
```

This function will return `True` if the expression is balanced and `False` otherwise.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/771 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct approach to solving the task. The plan to use a stack to keep track of the opening symbols and to match them with the closing symbols is a standard method for checking balanced expressions.

Plan:
1) Define the function `check_expression` that takes a single argument, `expression`, which is a string.
2) Create a dictionary `matching_brackets` that maps each closing bracket to its corresponding opening bracket.
3) Initialize an empty list `stack` to use as a stack.
4) Iterate over each character in the `expression`.
5) If the character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.
6) If the character is a closing bracket, check if the stack is empty or if the top element of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket. If either condition is true, return `False`.
7) After the iteration, if the stack is empty, return `True`, indicating that the expression is balanced. Otherwise, return `False`.

Code:
```python
def check_expression(expression):
    matching_brackets = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}
    stack = []
    
    for char in expression:
        if char in matching_brackets.values():  # If it's an opening bracket
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in matching_brackets:  # If it's a closing bracket
            if not stack or stack.pop() != matching_brackets[char]:
