"""
Write a function to find the third side of a right angled triangle.
assert otherside_rightangle(7,8)==10.63014581273465
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/293 [generation text] Answer: To find the third side of a right-angled triangle when given the lengths of the other two sides, you can use the Pythagorean theorem. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

Here's how you can conceptualize the function:

1. **Identify the Inputs**: The function will take two arguments, which represent the lengths of the two sides of the triangle. Let's call them `a` and `b`.

2. **Determine the Hypotenuse**: If `a` and `b` are the lengths of the two shorter sides, the hypotenuse `c` can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
   \]
   You can use the `math.sqrt()` function from the `math` module to compute the square root.

3. **Return the Result**: The function should return the calculated length of the hypotenuse.

4. **Handle Different Cases**: If you want to find the length of one of the other sides when the hypotenuse is known, you can rearrange the formula:
   \[
   \text{other side} = \sqrt{\text{hypotenuse}^2 - \text{given side}^2}
   \]
   You can implement logic to determine which side is the hypotenuse based on the input values.

Here is a simple implementation of the function:

```python
import math

def otherside_rightangle(a, b):
    return math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)

# Example usage
assert otherside_rightangle(7, 8) == 10.63014581273465
```

This function calculates the hypotenuse when given the two other sides of a right-angled triangle.

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

```python
import math

def otherside_rightangle(a, b):
    return math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)
```
INFO - program_code:
 import math

def otherside_rightangle(a, b):
    return math.sqrt(((a ** 2) + (b ** 2)))


INFO - program_name:
 otherside_rightangle

INFO - dependencies:
 []

INFO - raw_msg:
 Explain: The provided function incorrectly tries to determine which side is the hypotenuse and then calculates the other side. However, the task specifies that the function should calculate the hypotenuse given the other two sides. The Pythagorean theorem should be applied directly without checking which side is longer.

Plan:
1) Import the math module to use the sqrt function.
2) Define the function otherside_rightangle with two parameters, a and b.
3) Calculate the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem: c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2).
4) Return the calculated hypotenuse.

Code:
```python
import math

def otherside_rightangle(a, b):
    return math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)
```

INFO - no_parent:
 True

INFO - full code to be executed: 
 import math

def otherside_rightangle(a, b):
    return math.sqrt(((a ** 2) + (b ** 2)))
