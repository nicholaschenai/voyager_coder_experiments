"""
Write a function to calculate the sum of the negative numbers of a given list of numbers.

"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/133 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of calculating the sum of negative numbers in a given list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a list of numbers as an argument.

2. **Initialize a Sum Variable**: Inside the function, initialize a variable to keep track of the sum of negative numbers. You can set it to zero initially.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to iterate through each number in the list.

4. **Check for Negativity**: For each number, check if it is negative (i.e., less than zero).

5. **Accumulate the Sum**: If the number is negative, add it to the sum variable.

6. **Return the Result**: After the loop, return the sum variable, which now contains the total of all negative numbers.

7. **Assertion for Testing**: Use an assertion to test the function with the provided example to ensure it works correctly.

Here is a conceptual representation of the function:

```python
def sum_negativenum(numbers):
    total = 0  # Step 2: Initialize sum variable
    for num in numbers:  # Step 3: Iterate through the list
        if num < 0:  # Step 4: Check if the number is negative
            total += num  # Step 5: Accumulate the sum
    return total  # Step 6: Return the result

# Step 7: Assertion for testing
assert sum_negativenum([2, 4, -6, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 17]) == -32
```

This function will correctly calculate the sum of negative numbers in the provided list.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

The steps outlined are appropriate for the task and the provided code snippet is a good representation of what needs to be implemented.

Plan:
1) Define the function `sum_negativenum` that takes a list of numbers as its parameter.
2) Initialize a variable to keep track of the sum of negative numbers, starting at zero.
3) Iterate through each number in the list using a for loop.
4) Inside the loop, check if the current number is negative.
5) If the number is negative, add it to the sum variable.
6) After the loop, return the sum variable which contains the sum of all negative numbers.

Code:

    total = 0  # Initialize sum variable
    for num in numbers:  # Iterate through the list
