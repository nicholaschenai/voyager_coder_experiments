INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/748 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to put spaces between words starting with capital letters in a given string.
assert capital_words_spaces("Python") == 'Python'
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/748 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of inserting spaces between words that start with capital letters in a given string, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Iterate through the String**: Loop through each character in the string to examine its properties.

2. **Check for Capital Letters**: For each character, check if it is an uppercase letter. In Python, you can use the `isupper()` method to determine if a character is uppercase.

3. **Build a New String**: As you iterate, construct a new string. When you encounter an uppercase letter (except for the first character), append a space before it in the new string.

4. **Return the Result**: After processing all characters, return the newly constructed string.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic in Python:

```python
def capital_words_spaces(s):
    if not s:  # Handle empty string case
        return s
    result = s[0]  # Start with the first character
    for char in s[1:]:  # Iterate from the second character
        if char.isupper():  # Check if the character is uppercase
            result += ' '  # Add a space before the uppercase letter
        result += char  # Add the character to the result
    return result
```

This function will correctly insert spaces before capital letters in the string, while preserving the original case and order of the characters. The assertion provided in the question confirms that if the input is "Python", the output will remain "Python" since there are no additional capital letters to separate.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Task]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to put spaces between words starting with capital letters in a given string.
assert capital_words_spaces("Python") == 'Python'
"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of inserting spaces between words that start with capital letters in a given string, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Iterate through the String**: Loop through each character in the string to examine its properties.

2. **Check for Capital Letters**: For each character, check if it is an uppercase letter. In Python, you can use the `isupper()` method to determine if a character is uppercase.

3. **Build a New String**: As you iterate, construct a new string. When you encounter an uppercase letter (except for the first character), append a space before it in the new string.

4. **Return the Result**: After processing all characters, return the newly constructed string.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic in Python:

```python
def capital_words_spaces(s):
    if not s:  # Handle empty string case
        return s
    result = s[0]  # Start with the first character
    for char in s[1:]:  # Iterate from the second character
        if char.isupper():  # Check if the character is uppercase
            result += ' '  # Add a space before the uppercase letter
        result += char  # Add the character to the result
    return result
```

This function will correctly insert spaces before capital letters in the string, while preserving the original case and order of the characters. The assertion provided in the question confirms that if the input is "Python", the output will remain "Python" since there are no additional capital letters to separate.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/748 [generation text] Explain: The provided context outlines a correct approach to solve the task. The plan is to iterate through the string, check for capital letters, and insert spaces accordingly. The provided code snippet seems to follow the plan correctly, but it is important to note that the code snippet is just a conceptual example and not the final implementation. The task requires the function to be named `capital_words_spaces` and to pass the given assertion.

Plan:
1) Define the function `capital_words_spaces` that takes a single string argument.
2) Initialize a result string with the first character of the input string.
3) Iterate over the input string starting from the second character.
4) For each character, check if it is uppercase and not the first character.
5) If it is uppercase, append a space to the result string before appending the character.
6) If it is not uppercase, simply append the character to the result string.
7) Return the result string.

Code:
```python
def capital_words_spaces(s: str) -> str:
    # Initialize the result with the first character or an empty string if s is empty
    result = s[0] if s else ''
    # Iterate over the string starting from the second character
    for char in s[1:]:
        # If the character is uppercase, append a space before it
        if char.isupper():
            result += ' '
        result += char
    return result
```

This function should pass the assertion provided in the task.
