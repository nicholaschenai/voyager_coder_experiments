Write a function that returns integers x and y that satisfy ax + by = n as a tuple, or return None if no solution exists.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/160 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding integers \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy the equation \( ax + by = n \), you can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is a method for finding integer solutions to linear Diophantine equations.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of how to implement the function:

1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation \( ax + by = n \) has integer solutions if and only if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( a \) and \( b \) divides \( n \). If \( \text{gcd}(a, b) \) does not divide \( n \), return `None`.

2. **Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm**: This algorithm not only computes the gcd of two integers but also finds a way to express this gcd as a linear combination of the two integers. Specifically, it will give you integers \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \) such that:
   \[
   ax_0 + by_0 = \text{gcd}(a, b)
   \]

3. **Scale the Solution**: If \( d = \text{gcd}(a, b) \) divides \( n \), you can scale the solution \( (x_0, y_0) \) by \( \frac{n}{d} \) to get a particular solution \( (x, y) \):
   \[
   x = x_0 \cdot \frac{n}{d}, \quad y = y_0 \cdot \frac{n}{d}
   \]

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the tuple \( (x, y) \) as the solution.

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of the above logic in Python:

```python
def extended_gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a, 1, 0
    gcd, x1, y1 = extended_gcd(b, a % b)
    x = y1
    y = x1 - (a // b) * y1
    return gcd, x, y

def find_solution(a, b, n):
    gcd, x0, y0 = extended_gcd(a, b)
    if n % gcd != 0:
        return None  # No solution exists
    x = x0 * (n // gcd)
    y = y0 * (n // gcd)
    return (x, y)

# Example usage
assert find_solution(2, 3, 7) == (2, 1)
```

This function first computes the gcd and the coefficients using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, checks if a solution exists, and then scales the solution accordingly.

It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

Write a function that returns integers x and y that satisfy ax + by = n as a tuple, or return None if no solution exists.
assert find_solution(2, 3, 7) == (2, 1)
"""


[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding integers \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy the equation \( ax + by = n \), you can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is a method for finding integer solutions to linear Diophantine equations.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of how to implement the function:

1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation \( ax + by = n \) has integer solutions if and only if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( a \) and \( b \) divides \( n \). If \( \text{gcd}(a, b) \) does not divide \( n \), return `None`.

2. **Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm**: This algorithm not only computes the gcd of two integers but also finds a way to express this gcd as a linear combination of the two integers. Specifically, it will give you integers \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \) such that:
   \[
   ax_0 + by_0 = \text{gcd}(a, b)
   \]

3. **Scale the Solution**: If \( d = \text{gcd}(a, b) \) divides \( n \), you can scale the solution \( (x_0, y_0) \) by \( \frac{n}{d} \) to get a particular solution \( (x, y) \):
   \[
   x = x_0 \cdot \frac{n}{d}, \quad y = y_0 \cdot \frac{n}{d}
   \]

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the tuple \( (x, y) \) as the solution.

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of the above logic in Python:

```python
def extended_gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a, 1, 0
    gcd, x1, y1 = extended_gcd(b, a % b)
    x = y1
    y = x1 - (a // b) * y1
    return gcd, x, y

def find_solution(a, b, n):
    gcd, x0, y0 = extended_gcd(a, b)
    if n % gcd != 0:
        return None  # No solution exists
    x = x0 * (n // gcd)
    y = y0 * (n // gcd)
    return (x, y)

# Example usage
assert find_solution(2, 3, 7) == (2, 1)
```

This function first computes the gcd and the coefficients using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, checks if a solution exists, and then scales the solution accordingly.


[Critique]
The Extended Euclidean Algorithm implementation seems correct, but the issue may lie in how the results of the algorithm are being scaled to find the particular solution for the given 'n'. It's possible that the algorithm is finding a valid pair (x0, y0) for the gcd of 'a' and 'b', but when scaling it to 'n', it does not provide the expected solution. To improve the implementation, consider checking if there are alternative pairs (x, y) that satisfy the equation by adding multiples of 'b/gcd' to 'x' and subtracting multiples of 'a/gcd' from 'y', within a reasonable range, to find a solution that fits the expected output.


INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/160 [generation text] Explain: The Extended Euclidean Algorithm is correctly implemented, and the logic to scale the solution is also correct. However, the issue seems to be that the test expects a specific solution (2, 1) for the equation 2x + 3y = 7, but the algorithm may provide a different valid solution due to the nature of Diophantine equations having multiple solutions. The test case assumes a particular solution without considering that there could be other valid solutions.

Plan:
1) Modify the `find_solution` function to adjust the solution provided by the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the particular solution that the test case expects.
2) Since the test case expects positive solutions and the Extended Euclidean Algorithm may return negative or larger positive solutions, we will adjust the solution by adding and subtracting multiples of `b/gcd` and `a/gcd` respectively to find a solution that is closer to the expected one.
3) Return the adjusted solution as a tuple.

Code:
```python
def extended_gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a, 1, 0
    gcd, x1, y1 = extended_gcd(b, a % b)
    x = y1
    y = x1 - (a // b) * y1
    return gcd, x, y

def find_solution(a, b, n):
    gcd, x0, y0 = extended_gcd(a, b)
    if n % gcd != 0:
        return None  # No solution exists
    # Scale the solution
    x = x0 * (n // gcd)
    y = y0 * (n // gcd)
    
    # Adjust the solution to find the expected one
    # Since the test case expects positive solutions, we try to find the smallest positive x
    while x < 0 or y < 0:
        x += b // gcd
        y -= a // gcd
    
    return (x, y)
```

This code attempts to adjust the solution to find non-negative values for x and y, which is what the test case seems to expect. However, it's important to note that this adjustment is based on the assumption that the test case expects non-negative solutions, which may not always be the case for different inputs.
