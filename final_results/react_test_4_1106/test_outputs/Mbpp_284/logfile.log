INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/284 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function that takes in a list and element and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.
assert check_element(["green", "orange", "black", "white"],'blue')==False
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/284 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of checking whether all items in a list are equal to a given element in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes two parameters: a list and an element.

2. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to iterate through each item in the list.

3. **Comparison**: For each item, compare it with the given element.

4. **Check Equality**: If you find any item that is not equal to the given element, you can immediately return `False`.

5. **Return True**: If the loop completes without finding any unequal items, return `True`, indicating that all items are equal to the given element.

Here is a simple implementation of the above logic:

```python
def check_element(lst, element):
    for item in lst:
        if item != element:
            return False
    return True
```

In this function, if you call `check_element(["green", "orange", "black", "white"], 'blue')`, it will return `False` as expected, since none of the items in the list are equal to 'blue'.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/284 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan to implement the function. The steps outlined will achieve the task of checking if all items in the list are equal to the given element.

Plan:
1) Define the function `check_element` with two parameters: `lst` (the list to check) and `element` (the element to compare against).
2) Iterate over each item in the list `lst`.
3) Compare each item with the `element`. If any item is not equal to `element`, return `False`.
4) If the loop completes without returning `False`, it means all items are equal to `element`. Therefore, return `True`.

Code:
```python
def check_element(lst, element):
    for item in lst:
        if item != element:
            return False
    return True
