"""
Write a function to find the surface area of a cube of a given size.
assert surfacearea_cube(5)==150
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/441 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of writing a function to find the surface area of a cube in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand the Formula**: The surface area \( A \) of a cube with side length \( s \) is given by the formula:
   \[
   A = 6 \times s^2
   \]
   This is because a cube has 6 faces, and each face is a square with an area of \( s^2 \).

2. **Define the Function**: You will need to define a function named `surfacearea_cube` that takes one parameter, which represents the side length of the cube.

3. **Calculate the Surface Area**: Inside the function, use the formula to calculate the surface area based on the input side length.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the calculated surface area from the function.

5. **Testing the Function**: Use the provided assertion to test if your function works correctly. The assertion checks if the function returns 150 when the input is 5.

Here is a conceptual outline of the code:

```python
def surfacearea_cube(s):
    # Calculate the surface area using the formula
    surface_area = 6 * (s ** 2)
    return surface_area

# Test the function
assert surfacearea_cube(5) == 150
```

This code defines the function and checks that it behaves as expected for the given test case.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of writing a function to find the surface area of a cube in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand the Formula**: The surface area \( A \) of a cube with side length \( s \) is given by the formula:
   \[
   A = 6 \times s^2
   \]
   This is because a cube has 6 faces, and each face is a square with an area of \( s^2 \).

2. **Define the Function**: You will need to define a function named `surfacearea_cube` that takes one parameter, which represents the side length of the cube.

3. **Calculate the Surface Area**: Inside the function, use the formula to calculate the surface area based on the input side length.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the calculated surface area from the function.

5. **Testing the Function**: Use the provided assertion to test if your function works correctly. The assertion checks if the function returns 150 when the input is 5.

Here is a conceptual outline of the code:

```python
def surfacearea_cube(s):
    # Calculate the surface area using the formula
    surface_area = 6 * (s ** 2)
    return surface_area

# Test the function
assert surfacearea_cube(5) == 150
```

This code defines the function and checks that it behaves as expected for the given test case.
