Write a function to sort a dictionary by value.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/475 [generation text] Answer: To sort a dictionary by its values in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a dictionary as an argument.

2. **Use the `items()` Method**: This method returns a view object that displays a list of a dictionary's key-value tuple pairs. You can use this to access both keys and values.

3. **Sort the Items**: Use the `sorted()` function to sort the items. You can specify a custom sorting key using a lambda function that extracts the value from each key-value pair.

4. **Return the Sorted List**: Convert the sorted items back into a list of tuples and return it.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def sort_counter(counter):
    # Use sorted() to sort the items by value
    sorted_items = sorted(counter.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)
    return sorted_items
```

In this function:
- `counter.items()` retrieves the key-value pairs.
- `key=lambda item: item[1]` tells `sorted()` to sort based on the second element of each tuple (the value).
- `reverse=True` sorts the values in descending order.

Finally, the function returns the sorted list of tuples, which matches the expected output in the assertion.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/475 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan to accomplish the task. The steps outlined are appropriate for sorting a dictionary by its values in descending order and returning a list of tuples.

Plan:
1) Define the function `sort_counter` that takes a dictionary as an argument.
2) Use the `sorted()` function to sort the dictionary items by value in descending order. This is done by passing `counter.items()` to `sorted()` and using a lambda function as the key to sort by the value (the second item in each key-value tuple).
3) Return the sorted list of tuples.

Code:
```python
def sort_counter(counter):
