INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/730 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to remove consecutive duplicates of a given list.
assert consecutive_duplicates([0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 4 ])==[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4]
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/730 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of removing consecutive duplicates from a given list in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a list as an argument.

2. **Initialize an Empty List**: Create an empty list that will store the result without consecutive duplicates.

3. **Iterate Through the Input List**: Use a loop to go through each element in the input list.

4. **Check for Duplicates**: For each element, check if it is the same as the last element added to the result list. If it is not the same, append it to the result list.

5. **Return the Result**: After the loop, return the result list which now contains the elements without consecutive duplicates.

Here is a simple implementation of the above steps:

```python
def consecutive_duplicates(input_list):
    if not input_list:  # Handle empty list case
        return []
    
    result = [input_list[0]]  # Start with the first element
    
    for element in input_list[1:]:  # Iterate from the second element
        if element != result[-1]:  # Compare with the last element in result
            result.append(element)  # Append if it's not a duplicate
    
    return result

# Example usage
assert consecutive_duplicates([0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 4]) == [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4]
```

This function effectively removes consecutive duplicates while preserving the order of the elements.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/730 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan for implementing the function to remove consecutive duplicates from a list. The provided code snippet also seems to correctly implement the plan and should work as expected.

Plan:
1) Define the function `consecutive_duplicates` that takes a list as an argument.
2) Check if the input list is empty; if so, return an empty list.
3) Initialize a result list with the first element of the input list.
4) Iterate through the input list starting from the second element.
5) For each element, compare it with the last element in the result list.
6) If the current element is not the same as the last element in the result list, append it to the result list.
7) After the loop, return the result list which will contain the elements without consecutive duplicates.

Code:
```python
def consecutive_duplicates(input_list):
    # Handle empty list case
    if not input_list:
        return []
