"""
Write a python function to find the sum of fourth power of first n odd natural numbers.
assert odd_num_sum(2) == 82
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/770 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the sum of the fourth power of the first `n` odd natural numbers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand Odd Natural Numbers**: The first `n` odd natural numbers are 1, 3, 5, ..., which can be generated using the formula `2*i + 1` where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`.

2. **Calculate the Fourth Power**: For each odd number generated, compute its fourth power. This can be done using the exponentiation operator `**` in Python.

3. **Sum the Values**: Initialize a variable to accumulate the sum of these fourth powers. Loop through the first `n` odd numbers, calculate their fourth power, and add it to the sum.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the accumulated sum.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def odd_num_sum(n):
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(n):
        odd_number = 2 * i + 1  # Generate the i-th odd number
        total_sum += odd_number ** 4  # Add its fourth power to the total sum
    return total_sum
```

In this function:
- `n` is the number of odd natural numbers to consider.
- A loop iterates `n` times to generate each odd number and compute its fourth power.
- The result is accumulated in `total_sum`, which is returned at the end.

This approach ensures that you correctly compute the sum of the fourth powers of the first `n` odd natural numbers.

At each round of conversation, I will give you

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the sum of the fourth power of the first `n` odd natural numbers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Understand Odd Natural Numbers**: The first `n` odd natural numbers are 1, 3, 5, ..., which can be generated using the formula `2*i + 1` where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`.

2. **Calculate the Fourth Power**: For each odd number generated, compute its fourth power. This can be done using the exponentiation operator `**` in Python.

3. **Sum the Values**: Initialize a variable to accumulate the sum of these fourth powers. Loop through the first `n` odd numbers, calculate their fourth power, and add it to the sum.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the accumulated sum.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def odd_num_sum(n):
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(n):
        odd_number = 2 * i + 1  # Generate the i-th odd number
        total_sum += odd_number ** 4  # Add its fourth power to the total sum
    return total_sum
```

In this function:
- `n` is the number of odd natural numbers to consider.
- A loop iterates `n` times to generate each odd number and compute its fourth power.
- The result is accumulated in `total_sum`, which is returned at the end.

This approach ensures that you correctly compute the sum of the fourth powers of the first `n` odd natural numbers.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/770 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct plan to solve the task. We need to create a function that calculates the sum of the fourth powers of the first `n` odd natural numbers. The formula `2*i + 1` is correctly used to generate odd numbers, and the exponentiation operator `**` is used to raise these numbers to the fourth power.

Plan:
1) Define a function `odd_num_sum` that takes one argument `n`.
2) Initialize a variable `total_sum` to 0 to keep track of the sum of fourth powers.
3) Use a for loop to iterate from 0 to `n-1`.
4) In each iteration, calculate the odd number using `2*i + 1`.
5) Calculate the fourth power of the odd number and add it to `total_sum`.
6) After the loop, return `total_sum`.

Code:
```python
def odd_num_sum(n):
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(n):
        odd_number = 2 * i + 1  # Generate the i-th odd number
        total_sum += odd_number ** 4  # Add its fourth power to the total sum
    return total_sum
```

This function should pass the assertion `assert odd_num_sum(2) == 82`.
