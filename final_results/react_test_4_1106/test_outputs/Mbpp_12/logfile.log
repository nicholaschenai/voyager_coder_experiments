Write a function to sort a given matrix in ascending order according to the sum of its rows.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/12 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of sorting a matrix in ascending order based on the sum of its rows in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a matrix (a list of lists) as an argument.

2. **Calculate Row Sums**: For each row in the matrix, calculate the sum of its elements. This can be done using the built-in `sum()` function.

3. **Sort the Matrix**: Use the `sorted()` function or the `sort()` method to sort the rows of the matrix. You can provide a custom key to the sorting function, which will be the sum of each row. This can be achieved using a lambda function that returns the sum of the row.

4. **Return the Sorted Matrix**: After sorting, return the newly sorted matrix.

Here is a conceptual outline of the code:

```python
def sort_matrix(matrix):
    # Sort the matrix based on the sum of each row
    return sorted(matrix, key=lambda row: sum(row))

# Example usage
assert sort_matrix([[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5], [1, 1, 1]]) == [[1, 1, 1], [1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5]]
```

In this code:
- `sorted(matrix, key=lambda row: sum(row))` sorts the matrix by the sum of each row.
- The `assert` statement checks that the function works as expected.

This approach is efficient and leverages Python's built-in capabilities for sorting and summing.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of sorting a matrix in ascending order based on the sum of its rows in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a matrix (a list of lists) as an argument.

2. **Calculate Row Sums**: For each row in the matrix, calculate the sum of its elements. This can be done using the built-in `sum()` function.

4. **Return the Sorted Matrix**: After sorting, return the newly sorted matrix.

Here is a conceptual outline of the code:

```python

    # Sort the matrix based on the sum of each row
    return sorted(matrix, key=lambda row: sum(row))

In this code:
- `sorted(matrix, key=lambda row: sum(row))` sorts the matrix by the sum of each row.
- The `assert` statement checks that the function works as expected.

This approach is efficient and leverages Python's built-in capabilities for sorting and summing.
