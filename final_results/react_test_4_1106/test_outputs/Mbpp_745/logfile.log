"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/745 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding numbers within a specified range that are divisible by each of their digits, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `divisible_by_digits` that takes two parameters: `startnum` and `endnum`.

2. **Iterate Through the Range**: Use a loop to iterate through each number in the range from `startnum` to `endnum` (inclusive).

3. **Check Each Number's Digits**: For each number, convert it to a string to easily access each digit. 

4. **Check Divisibility**: For each digit in the number:
   - Convert the digit back to an integer.
   - Check if the digit is not zero (to avoid division by zero).
   - Check if the number is divisible by the digit using the modulus operator (`%`).

5. **Collect Valid Numbers**: If a number is divisible by all of its non-zero digits, add it to a list of valid numbers.

6. **Return the Result**: After checking all numbers in the range, return the list of valid numbers.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def divisible_by_digits(startnum, endnum):
    result = []
    for num in range(startnum, endnum + 1):
        str_num = str(num)
        if all(num % int(digit) == 0 for digit in str_num if digit != '0'):
            result.append(num)
    return result
```

This function uses a list comprehension with the `all()` function to ensure that the number is divisible by all of its digits, excluding zero. The final result is a list of numbers that meet the criteria.

You are a Python programming assistant that assesses my progress of Python programming and provides useful guidance.

[Task]: The objective I need to accomplish.
[Context]: The context of the task. Serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help me on the task, but my priority is to follow instructions in the Task tag.
[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

To overcome this error, we should change the condition to only update the result when the current subarray length is strictly greater than the previous longest subarray length.

This function uses a list comprehension with the `all()` function to ensure that the number is divisible by all of its digits, excluding zero. The final result is a list of numbers that meet the criteria.


[Critique]
To fix the implementation, the function should not only check if the number is divisible by its non-zero digits but also ensure that the number does not contain the digit '0'. This can be done by adding an additional condition to exclude numbers with '0' before checking divisibility by other digits.


INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/745 [generation text] Explain: The previous implementation of the function `divisible_by_digits` incorrectly included numbers that contain the digit '0' in the result list. According to the task, a number should only be included if it is divisible by every digit it contains, and since division by zero is undefined, any number containing a '0' should be excluded from the result.

Plan:
1) Define the function `divisible_by_digits` with parameters `startnum` and `endnum`.
2) Create an empty list `result` to store numbers that meet the criteria.
3) Iterate through each number in the range from `startnum` to `endnum` (inclusive).
4) For each number, convert it to a string to access each digit.
5) Check if the number contains the digit '0'. If it does, skip to the next number.
6) If the number does not contain '0', check if the number is divisible by each of its digits.
7) If the number is divisible by all of its digits, append it to the `result` list.
8) Return the `result` list after the loop ends.

Code:
```python
def divisible_by_digits(startnum, endnum):
    result = []
    for num in range(startnum, endnum + 1):
        str_num = str(num)
        # Skip the number if it contains '0'
        if '0' in str_num:
            continue
        # Check if the number is divisible by each of its digits
        if all(num % int(digit) == 0 for digit in str_num):
            result.append(num)
    return result
```

INFO - raw_msg:
 Explain: The previous implementation of the function `divisible_by_digits` incorrectly included numbers that contain the digit '0' in the result list. According to the task, a number should only be included if it is divisible by every digit it contains, and since division by zero is undefined, any number containing a '0' should be excluded from the result.

Plan:
1) Define the function `divisible_by_digits` with parameters `startnum` and `endnum`.
2) Create an empty list `result` to store numbers that meet the criteria.
3) Iterate through each number in the range from `startnum` to `endnum` (inclusive).
4) For each number, convert it to a string to access each digit.
5) Check if the number contains the digit '0'. If it does, skip to the next number.
6) If the number does not contain '0', check if the number is divisible by each of its digits.
7) If the number is divisible by all of its digits, append it to the `result` list.
8) Return the `result` list after the loop ends.

```python
def divisible_by_digits(startnum, endnum):
    result = []
    for num in range(startnum, endnum + 1):
