INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/20 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
"""
Write a function to check if the given number is woodball or not.
assert is_woodall(383) == True
"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/20 [generation text] Answer: To determine if a number is a Woodall number, you need to understand the definition of Woodall numbers. A Woodall number is defined as a number of the form \( n \times 2^n - 1 \), where \( n \) is a non-negative integer.

To accomplish the task in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `is_woodall` that takes a single argument (the number to check).

2. **Generate Woodall Numbers**: Inside the function, you will need to generate Woodall numbers for various values of \( n \) until the generated number exceeds the input number. This can be done using a loop.

3. **Check for Equality**: For each generated Woodall number, check if it matches the input number. If a match is found, return `True`. If the loop completes without finding a match, return `False`.

4. **Use Assertions**: You can use assertions to test your function, as shown in the example.

Here is a conceptual outline of the code:

```python
def is_woodall(num):
    n = 0
    while True:
        woodall_number = n * (2 ** n) - 1
        if woodall_number == num:
            return True
        elif woodall_number > num:
            return False
        n += 1

# Example usage
assert is_woodall(383) == True
```

This function will correctly identify whether the given number is a Woodall number or not.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

[Task]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to check if the given number is woodball or not.

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To determine if a number is a Woodall number, you need to understand the definition of Woodall numbers. A Woodall number is defined as a number of the form \( n \times 2^n - 1 \), where \( n \) is a non-negative integer.

To accomplish the task in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `is_woodall` that takes a single argument (the number to check).

2. **Generate Woodall Numbers**: Inside the function, you will need to generate Woodall numbers for various values of \( n \) until the generated number exceeds the input number. This can be done using a loop.

3. **Check for Equality**: For each generated Woodall number, check if it matches the input number. If a match is found, return `True`. If the loop completes without finding a match, return `False`.

4. **Use Assertions**: You can use assertions to test your function, as shown in the example.

Here is a conceptual outline of the code:

```python
def is_woodall(num):
    n = 0
    while True:
        woodall_number = n * (2 ** n) - 1
        if woodall_number == num:
            return True
        elif woodall_number > num:
            return False
        n += 1

# Example usage
assert is_woodall(383) == True
```

This function will correctly identify whether the given number is a Woodall number or not.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/20 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a correct definition of Woodall numbers and a suitable plan to implement the function. The steps outlined are appropriate for the task at hand.

Plan:
1) Define the function `is_woodall` that takes an integer `num` as its argument.
2) Initialize a variable `n` to 1 because the definition of Woodall numbers starts with \( n \) being a positive integer.
3) Use a while loop to generate Woodall numbers using the formula \( n \times 2^n - 1 \).
4) In each iteration, check if the generated Woodall number is equal to the input `num`. If it is, return `True`.
5) If the generated Woodall number exceeds the input `num`, break the loop and return `False` because all subsequent Woodall numbers will be larger.
6) Increment `n` by 1 in each iteration to check the next Woodall number.

Code:
```python
def is_woodall(num):
    n = 1  # Start with n = 1 as Woodall numbers are defined for positive integers
    while True:
        woodall_number = n * (2 ** n) - 1
        if woodall_number == num:
