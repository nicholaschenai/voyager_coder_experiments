Write a function to return two words from a list of words starting with letter 'p'.

"""

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/305 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of writing a function that returns two words from a list of words starting with the letter 'p', you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function named `start_withp` that takes a list of strings as an argument.

2. **Initialize a List**: Inside the function, create an empty list to store words that start with the letter 'p'.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to iterate through each string in the input list.

4. **Split the Strings**: For each string, split it into individual words. This can be done using the `split()` method, which separates the string based on spaces.

5. **Check Each Word**: For each word obtained from the split operation, check if it starts with the letter 'p' (case-sensitive). You can use the `startswith()` method for this purpose.

6. **Store Matching Words**: If a word starts with 'p', append it to the list you initialized earlier.

7. **Return the Result**: Once you have collected all the words that start with 'p', return the first two words from the list. If there are fewer than two words, you may need to handle that case appropriately (e.g., returning whatever is available).

8. **Use Assertions for Testing**: Finally, you can use assertions to test your function against the provided example to ensure it behaves as expected.

Here is a conceptual outline of what the code might look like:

```python
def start_withp(words):
    p_words = []
    for phrase in words:
        for word in phrase.split():
            if word.startswith('p'):
                p_words.append(word)
                if len(p_words) == 2:  # Stop if we have found two words
                    return tuple(p_words)
    return tuple(p_words)  # Return whatever is found, even if less than two
```

This function will return a tuple of the first two words that start with 'p' from the provided list of phrases.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
[Environment feedback] (after executing code) ...
[Code from the last round] ...
[Task] ...
[Context] ...
[Critique] ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?
Plan: How to complete the task step by step. 
Code:
    1) Reuse or reference the above useful programs if necessary.
    2) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. 
    3) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    4) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    5) Do not write infinite loops.
    6) If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!). Else, name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    7) Your code should only contain elements that solve the task, so DO NOT write any assert statements / tests
    8) The context in the [Context] tag serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help you on the task, but your priority is to follow instructions in the [Task] tag.

You should only respond in the format as described below:

                    return tuple(p_words)
    return tuple(p_words)  # Return whatever is found, even if less than two
```

This function will return a tuple of the first two words that start with 'p' from the provided list of phrases.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/305 [generation text] Explain: The context provides a good plan for the task. However, it is important to note that the function should return a tuple of exactly two words that start with the letter 'p'. If there are not enough words starting with 'p', the function should not return anything, as the assertion expects a tuple with exactly two elements.

Plan:
1) Define the function `start_withp` that takes a list of strings as an argument.
2) Initialize an empty list to store words that start with the letter 'p'.
3) Iterate through each string in the input list.
4) For each string, split it into individual words using the `split()` method.
5) For each word, check if it starts with the letter 'p' using the `startswith()` method.
6) If a word starts with 'p', append it to the list.
7) If the list of words starting with 'p' has at least two words, return the first two words as a tuple.
8) If there are not enough words starting with 'p', do not return anything.

Code:
```python
def start_withp(words):
    p_words = []
    for phrase in words:
        for word in phrase.split():
            if word.startswith('p') or word.startswith('P'):
