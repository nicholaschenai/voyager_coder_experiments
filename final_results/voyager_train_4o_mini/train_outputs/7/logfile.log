You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should ask at least 5 questions (but no more than 10 questions) to help me decide the next immediate task to do. Each question should be followed by the concept that the question is about.
2) Your question should be specific to a concept in Python programming.
  Bad example (the question is too general):
    Question: What is the best way to program in Python?
    Concept: unknown
  Good example:
    Question: How do you reverse a list?
    Concept: list
3) Your questions should be self-contained and not require any context.

INFO - [Task id] 7 [prompt] Question: How can you find the maximum value in a list without using the built-in max function?
INFO - [Task id] 7 [generation text] Answer: You can find the maximum value in a list by iterating through the list and keeping track of the largest value found so far. Here’s an example of how to do this:

```python
def find_maximum(lst):
    if not lst:  # Check if the list is empty
        return None  # or raise an exception

    max_value = lst[0]  # Assume the first element is the maximum
    for num in lst:
        if num > max_value:
            max_value = num  # Update max_value if a larger number is found
    return max_value

# Example usage:
numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5]
print(find_maximum(numbers))  # Output: 9
```

This function initializes `max_value` with the first element of the list and then iterates through each element, updating `max_value` whenever it finds a larger number.

Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. As a rule of thumb, guide me through beginner problems, followed by interview level problems, followed by competitive programming problems. The latter 2 levels can involve concepts from data structures and algorithms.
2) Please be very specific about what skills I need to learn.
3) Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for problems which I have not solved yet. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) The task should involve writing a main Python function that at most use basic libraries (try not to import too many or too advanced modules)
7) Do not give tasks that require file operations (create, read, update, delete) or an internet connection.
8) I am only allowed to write Python functions, so do not require me to write other things (e.g. objects). 
9) Requiring me to write a function that takes in an object and uses object methods is still ok, but I cannot define the objects myself. You must provide the objects as input to my function in the assert statement.

Take note of these in your response:
1) Give an expected function name for the task.
2) Give a tuple of 3 assert statements that tests the function's correctness in the "test_tuple" field. This must strictly contain single-line assert statements only; any setup code for the test must be filled in the "test_setup_code" field.
3) The function name which you gave must be called in the assert statements.

    ]
}

INFO - [Task id] 7 [prompt] Question 1: How do you sort a list of integers in ascending order?
Answer: You can sort a list of integers in ascending order in Python using the `sort()` method or the `sorted()` function. 

Here are examples of both methods:

1. Using the `sort()` method (this sorts the list in place):
```python
numbers = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]
numbers.sort()
print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]
```

2. Using the `sorted()` function (this returns a new sorted list):
```python
numbers = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]
sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
print(sorted_numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]
```

Both methods will sort the list in ascending order by default.

Question 2: What is the best way to merge two dictionaries in Python?
Answer: The best way to merge two dictionaries in Python depends on the version of Python you are using. 

In Python 3.9 and later, you can use the `|` operator to merge dictionaries:

```python
dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
dict2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}
merged_dict = dict1 | dict2
```

In Python 3.5 and later, you can use the `**` unpacking operator:

```python
dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
dict2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}
merged_dict = {**dict1, **dict2}
```

In earlier versions of Python, you can use the `update()` method:

```python
dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
dict2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}
dict1.update(dict2)
merged_dict = dict1  # dict1 is now updated
```

Choose the method that best fits your needs and the version of Python you are using.

Question 3: How can you find the maximum value in a list without using the built-in max function?
Answer: You can find the maximum value in a list by iterating through the list and keeping track of the largest value found so far. Here’s an example of how to do this:

```python
def find_maximum(lst):
    if not lst:  # Check if the list is empty
        return None  # or raise an exception

    max_value = lst[0]  # Assume the first element is the maximum
    for num in lst:
        if num > max_value:
            max_value = num  # Update max_value if a larger number is found
    return max_value

# Example usage:
numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5]
print(find_maximum(numbers))  # Output: 9
```

This function initializes `max_value` with the first element of the list and then iterates through each element, updating `max_value` whenever it finds a larger number.

Question 4: How do you create a list comprehension to generate a list of squares from a list of integers?
Answer: You can create a list comprehension to generate a list of squares from a list of integers by iterating over the list and squaring each integer. Here’s an example:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = [x**2 for x in numbers]
```

In this example, `squares` will contain the values `[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]`, which are the squares of the integers in the `numbers` list.

Question 5: What is the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy of a list?
Answer: A shallow copy of a list creates a new list object, but it does not create copies of the objects contained in the original list. Instead, it copies references to those objects. This means that if the original list contains mutable objects (like other lists or dictionaries), changes made to those mutable objects in the shallow copy will also reflect in the original list, and vice versa.

On the other hand, a deep copy creates a new list and recursively copies all objects found in the original list, meaning that it creates copies of the objects themselves, not just references. As a result, changes made to the objects in the deep copy do not affect the original list.

In Python, you can create a shallow copy using the `list.copy()` method or the `copy` module's `copy()` function, and a deep copy using the `copy` module's `deepcopy()` function. 

Example:
```python
import copy

original_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

shallow_copied_list = copy.copy(original_list)
deep_copied_list = copy.deepcopy(original_list)

shallow_copied_list[0][0] = 'X'
deep_copied_list[1][0] = 'Y'

print(original_list)          # Output: [['X', 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
print(shallow_copied_list)   # Output: [['X', 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
print(deep_copied_list)      # Output: [[1, 2, 3], ['Y', 5, 6]]
```
In this example, modifying the shallow copy affects the original list, while modifying the deep copy does not.

INFO - [Task id] 7 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the even integers from the original list.
INFO - [Task id] 7 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of creating a function that filters out even integers from a list of integers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a single parameter, which will be the list of integers.

2. **Initialize an Empty List**: Inside the function, create an empty list that will hold the even integers.

3. **Iterate Through the Input List**: Use a loop to go through each integer in the input list.

4. **Check for Evenness**: For each integer, check if it is even. In Python, an integer is even if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., `number % 2 == 0`).

5. **Append Even Integers**: If the integer is even, append it to the empty list you initialized earlier.

6. **Return the New List**: After the loop has finished, return the new list containing only the even integers.

Here is a simple example of how the function might look in code:

```python
def filter_even_numbers(input_list):
    even_numbers = []  # Step 2: Initialize an empty list
    for number in input_list:  # Step 3: Iterate through the input list
        if number % 2 == 0:  # Step 4: Check if the number is even
            even_numbers.append(number)  # Step 5: Append to the list
    return even_numbers  # Step 6: Return the new list
```

This function can then be called with a list of integers, and it will return a new list containing only the even integers from the original list.

Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the even integers from the original list.
You must strictly follow the function name: filter_even_numbers

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of creating a function that filters out even integers from a list of integers in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a single parameter, which will be the list of integers.

2. **Initialize an Empty List**: Inside the function, create an empty list that will hold the even integers.

3. **Iterate Through the Input List**: Use a loop to go through each integer in the input list.

4. **Check for Evenness**: For each integer, check if it is even. In Python, an integer is even if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., `number % 2 == 0`).

5. **Append Even Integers**: If the integer is even, append it to the empty list you initialized earlier.

6. **Return the New List**: After the loop has finished, return the new list containing only the even integers.

Here is a simple example of how the function might look in code:

```python
def filter_even_numbers(input_list):
    even_numbers = []  # Step 2: Initialize an empty list
    for number in input_list:  # Step 3: Iterate through the input list
        if number % 2 == 0:  # Step 4: Check if the number is even
            even_numbers.append(number)  # Step 5: Append to the list
    return even_numbers  # Step 6: Return the new list
```

This function can then be called with a list of integers, and it will return a new list containing only the even integers from the original list.

INFO - [Task id] 7 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct and outlines the necessary steps to filter even integers from a list. The example code also accurately implements the plan. There are no missing steps, and the approach is clear and straightforward.

Plan:
1) Define the function `filter_even_numbers` that takes a list of integers as an argument.
2) Initialize an empty list to store the even integers.
3) Iterate through each integer in the input list.
4) Check if the integer is even using the modulus operator.
5) If the integer is even, append it to the list of even integers.
6) Return the list of even integers after the loop completes.

Code:
```python
def filter_even_numbers(input_list):
    even_numbers = []  # Step 2: Initialize an empty list
    for number in input_list:  # Step 3: Iterate through the input list
        if number % 2 == 0:  # Step 4: Check if the number is even
            even_numbers.append(number)  # Step 5: Append to the list
    return even_numbers  # Step 6: Return the new list

You are a Python programming assistant that assesses my progress of Python programming and provides useful guidance.

I will give you the following information:

[Task]: The objective I need to accomplish.
[Context]: The context of the task. Serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help me on the task, but my priority is to follow instructions in the Task tag.
[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

You should only respond in JSON format as described below:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:

To overcome this error, we should change the condition to only update the result when the current subarray length is strictly greater than the previous longest subarray length.

The main function is `filter_even_numbers`.
INFO - [Task id] 7 [generation text] This function takes a list of numbers as input and iterates through each number to check if it is even. If a number is found to be even (i.e., divisible by 2 with no remainder), it is added to a new list. After processing all the numbers, the function returns the list containing only the even numbers. The output will be an array that excludes any odd numbers from the original input. This allows users to easily filter out even values from a mixed list of integers. The function effectively provides a simple way to identify and collect even numbers.
