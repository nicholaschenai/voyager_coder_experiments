    "reasoning": "The implementation successfully swaps the keys and values of the input dictionary, but it does not handle duplicate values correctly. In the test case where the input dictionary has duplicate values, the implementation will overwrite the previous key with the new one, which is not the intended behavior. The task requires that only one key is kept for each unique value, and the implementation should check for duplicates before adding to the swapped dictionary.",
