You are a helpful assistant that answer my question about Python programming.

I will give you the following information:
Question: ...

You will answer the question based on the context (only if available and helpful) and your own knowledge of Python programming.
1) Start your answer with "Answer: ".
2) Answer "Answer: Unknown" if you don't know the answer.

INFO - [Task id] 44 [prompt] Question: How do you implement a function that checks if a number is prime?
INFO - [Task id] 44 [generation text] Answer: To implement a function that checks if a number is prime in Python, you can follow these steps:

1. A prime number is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
2. You can check for divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.

Here is a sample implementation:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

You can use this function by passing an integer to it, and it will return `True` if the number is prime and `False` otherwise. For example:

```python
print(is_prime(11))  # Output: True
print(is_prime(4))   # Output: False
```

INFO - [Task id] 44 [prompt] Question: What is the method to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion?
INFO - [Task id] 44 [generation text] Answer: To calculate the factorial of a number using recursion in Python, you can define a function that calls itself with a decremented value until it reaches the base case. Here is an example of how to implement this:

```python
def factorial(n):
    # Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Example usage:
result = factorial(5)  # This will return 120
print(result)
```

In this code, the `factorial` function checks if `n` is 0 or 1, in which case it returns 1. For any other positive integer, it returns `n` multiplied by the factorial of `n - 1`, effectively breaking the problem down into smaller subproblems until it reaches the base case.

Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. As a rule of thumb, guide me through beginner problems, followed by interview level problems, followed by competitive programming problems. The latter 2 levels can involve concepts from data structures and algorithms.
2) Please be very specific about what skills I need to learn.
3) Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for problems which I have not solved yet. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) The task should involve writing a main Python function that at most use basic libraries (try not to import too many or too advanced modules)
7) Do not give tasks that require file operations (create, read, update, delete) or an internet connection.
8) I am only allowed to write Python functions, so do not require me to write other things (e.g. objects). 
9) Requiring me to write a function that takes in an object and uses object methods is still ok, but I cannot define the objects myself. You must provide the objects as input to my function in the assert statement.

Take note of these in your response:
1) Give an expected function name for the task.
2) Give a tuple of 3 assert statements that tests the function's correctness in the "test_tuple" field. This must strictly contain single-line assert statements only; any setup code for the test must be filled in the "test_setup_code" field.
3) The function name which you gave must be called in the assert statements. 

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.

INFO - [Task id] 44 [prompt] Question 1: How do you implement a function that checks if a number is prime?
Answer: To implement a function that checks if a number is prime in Python, you can follow these steps:

1. A prime number is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
2. You can check for divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.

Here is a sample implementation:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

You can use this function by passing an integer to it, and it will return `True` if the number is prime and `False` otherwise. For example:

```python
print(is_prime(11))  # Output: True
print(is_prime(4))   # Output: False
```

Question 2: What is the best way to merge two dictionaries while handling duplicate keys?
Answer: In Python, you can merge two dictionaries while handling duplicate keys using several methods. Here are a few common approaches:

1. **Using the `update()` method**: This method updates the first dictionary with the second one. If there are duplicate keys, the values from the second dictionary will overwrite those in the first.

   ```python
   dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
   dict2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}
   dict1.update(dict2)
   # dict1 is now {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
   ```

2. **Using dictionary comprehension**: You can create a new dictionary that combines both, allowing you to define how to handle duplicates.

   ```python
   dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
   dict2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}
   merged_dict = {k: dict2.get(k, dict1.get(k)) for k in set(dict1) | set(dict2)}
   # merged_dict is now {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
   ```

3. **Using the `|` operator (Python 3.9 and later)**: This operator allows you to merge dictionaries easily. In case of duplicate keys, the values from the second dictionary will take precedence.

   ```python
   dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
   dict2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}
   merged_dict = dict1 | dict2
   # merged_dict is now {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
   ```

4. **Using `collections.ChainMap`**: This allows you to create a view that combines multiple dictionaries, but it does not create a new dictionary. The first dictionary's values will be used in case of duplicates.

   ```python
   from collections import ChainMap

   dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
   dict2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}
   merged = ChainMap(dict2, dict1)
   # Accessing merged['b'] will return 3
   ```

Choose the method that best fits your needs based on how you want to handle duplicate keys.

Question 3: How can you find the longest word in a list of strings?
Answer: You can find the longest word in a list of strings by using the `max()` function along with the `key` parameter to specify that you want to compare the lengths of the words. Here’s an example:

```python
words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
longest_word = max(words, key=len)
print(longest_word)
```

In this example, `max()` will return the longest word from the list `words`, which is "banana". The `key=len` argument tells `max()` to use the length of each word for comparison.

Question 4: What is the method to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion?
Answer: To calculate the factorial of a number using recursion in Python, you can define a function that calls itself with a decremented value until it reaches the base case. Here is an example of how to implement this:

```python
def factorial(n):
    # Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Example usage:
result = factorial(5)  # This will return 120
print(result)
```

In this code, the `factorial` function checks if `n` is 0 or 1, in which case it returns 1. For any other positive integer, it returns `n` multiplied by the factorial of `n - 1`, effectively breaking the problem down into smaller subproblems until it reaches the base case.

Question 5: How do you create a class in Python and instantiate an object from it?
Answer: To create a class in Python, you use the `class` keyword followed by the class name and a colon. Inside the class, you can define methods and attributes. To instantiate an object from the class, you simply call the class as if it were a function.

Here is an example:

```python
# Define a class
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # Instance variable for the dog's name
        self.age = age    # Instance variable for the dog's age

    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"

# Instantiate an object from the class
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)

# Accessing attributes and methods
print(my_dog.name)  # Output: Buddy
print(my_dog.age)   # Output: 3
print(my_dog.bark())  # Output: Buddy says woof!
```

In this example, we created a `Dog` class with an initializer method (`__init__`) to set the name and age of the dog. We then created an instance of `Dog` called `my_dog` and accessed its attributes and methods.

INFO - [Task id] 44 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
Write a Python function that takes a string and returns a new string where each word is reversed but the order of the words is preserved.
INFO - [Task id] 44 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of reversing each word in a string while preserving the order of the words, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Split the String**: Use the `split()` method to break the input string into a list of words. This method splits the string at whitespace by default.

2. **Reverse Each Word**: Iterate over the list of words and reverse each word. You can reverse a string in Python using slicing (`word[::-1]`).

3. **Join the Words**: After reversing each word, use the `join()` method to combine the list of reversed words back into a single string, with a space as the separator.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the newly formed string.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def reverse_words(input_string):
    # Step 1: Split the string into words
    words = input_string.split()
    
    # Step 2: Reverse each word
    reversed_words = [word[::-1] for word in words]
    
    # Step 3: Join the reversed words into a new string
    result = ' '.join(reversed_words)
    
    # Step 4: Return the result
    return result
```

This function will take an input string, reverse each word, and return the modified string with the original word order preserved.

You are a Python programming assistant that assesses my progress of Python programming and provides useful guidance.

I will give you the following information:

[Task]: The objective I need to accomplish.
[Context]: The context of the task. Serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help me on the task, but my priority is to follow instructions in the Task tag.
[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)
