You are a helpful assistant that asks questions to help me decide the next immediate task to do for Python programming.
My ultimate goal is to solve as many diverse problems as possible and become the best programmer in the world.

I will give you the following information:
Completed tasks so far: ...
Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should ask at least 5 questions (but no more than 10 questions) to help me decide the next immediate task to do. Each question should be followed by the concept that the question is about.
2) Your question should be specific to a concept in Python programming.
  Bad example (the question is too general):
    Question: What is the best way to program in Python?
    Concept: unknown
  Good example:
    Question: How do you reverse a list?
    Concept: list
3) Your questions should be self-contained and not require any context.

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```

Question: ...

You will answer the question based on the context (only if available and helpful) and your own knowledge of Python programming.
1) Start your answer with "Answer: ".
2) Answer "Answer: Unknown" if you don't know the answer.

INFO - [Task id] 50 [prompt] Question: How can you create a function that checks if a string is a valid email address?
INFO - [Task id] 50 [generation text] Answer: You can create a function to check if a string is a valid email address using regular expressions in Python. Here's an example of how you can do this:

```python
import re

def is_valid_email(email):
    # Define a regular expression for validating an Email
    email_regex = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'
    
    # Use re.match to check if the email matches the regex
    if re.match(email_regex, email):
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Example usage
email = "example@example.com"
print(is_valid_email(email))  # Output: True
```

In this function, `is_valid_email`, we use a regular expression to define the pattern of a valid email address. The `re.match` function checks if the input string matches the defined pattern, returning `True` for valid emails and `False` otherwise.

INFO - [Task id] 50 [prompt] Question: How do you read a CSV file and convert it into a list of dictionaries in Python?
INFO - [Task id] 50 [generation text] Answer: You can read a CSV file and convert it into a list of dictionaries in Python using the `csv` module. Here’s an example of how to do this:

```python
import csv

# Define the path to your CSV file
csv_file_path = 'your_file.csv'

# Initialize an empty list to store the dictionaries
data_list = []

# Open the CSV file
with open(csv_file_path, mode='r', newline='') as csvfile:
    # Create a CSV reader object
    csv_reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)
    
    # Iterate over each row in the CSV file
    for row in csv_reader:
        # Append the row (as a dictionary) to the list
        data_list.append(row)

# Now data_list contains the CSV data as a list of dictionaries
print(data_list)
```

In this code:
- `csv.DictReader` reads the CSV file and maps the information in each row to a dictionary using the header row as keys.
- Each row is appended to the `data_list`, resulting in a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a row in the CSV file.

INFO - [Task id] 50 [prompt] Question: How can you implement a basic sorting algorithm (like bubble sort) in Python?
INFO - [Task id] 50 [generation text] Answer: You can implement a basic sorting algorithm like bubble sort in Python using the following code:

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Traverse through all array elements
    for i in range(n):
        # Last i elements are already sorted
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            # Traverse the array from 0 to n-i-1
            # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]

# Example usage
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
bubble_sort(arr)
print("Sorted array is:", arr)
```

In this implementation, the `bubble_sort` function takes a list `arr` as input and sorts it in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm. The algorithm repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.

Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. As a rule of thumb, guide me through beginner problems, followed by interview level problems, followed by competitive programming problems. The latter 2 levels can involve concepts from data structures and algorithms.
2) Please be very specific about what skills I need to learn.
3) Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for problems which I have not solved yet. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) The task should involve writing a main Python function that at most use basic libraries (try not to import too many or too advanced modules)
7) Do not give tasks that require file operations (create, read, update, delete) or an internet connection.
8) I am only allowed to write Python functions, so do not require me to write other things (e.g. objects). 
9) Requiring me to write a function that takes in an object and uses object methods is still ok, but I cannot define the objects myself. You must provide the objects as input to my function in the assert statement.

Take note of these in your response:
1) Give an expected function name for the task.
2) Give a tuple of 3 assert statements that tests the function's correctness in the "test_tuple" field. This must strictly contain single-line assert statements only; any setup code for the test must be filled in the "test_setup_code" field.
3) The function name which you gave must be called in the assert statements. 

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

        "assert find_zero_sum([1, 4, 3, -4, -1]) == (4, -4)"
    ]
}

INFO - [Task id] 50 [prompt] Question 1: How do you find the maximum value in a list of integers without using the built-in max function?
Answer: You can find the maximum value in a list of integers by iterating through the list and keeping track of the largest value found so far. Here’s a simple implementation:

```python
def find_maximum(numbers):
    if not numbers:  # Check if the list is empty
        return None  # or raise an exception

    max_value = numbers[0]  # Assume the first number is the maximum
    for number in numbers:
        if number > max_value:
            max_value = number  # Update max_value if a larger number is found
    return max_value

# Example usage:
numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5]
print(find_maximum(numbers))  # Output: 9
```

This function initializes `max_value` with the first element of the list and then iterates through the list, updating `max_value` whenever it finds a larger number.

Question 2: How can you create a function that checks if a string is a valid email address?
Answer: You can create a function to check if a string is a valid email address using regular expressions in Python. Here's an example of how you can do this:

```python
import re

def is_valid_email(email):
    # Define a regular expression for validating an Email
    email_regex = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'
    
    # Use re.match to check if the email matches the regex
    if re.match(email_regex, email):
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Example usage
email = "example@example.com"
print(is_valid_email(email))  # Output: True
```

In this function, `is_valid_email`, we use a regular expression to define the pattern of a valid email address. The `re.match` function checks if the input string matches the defined pattern, returning `True` for valid emails and `False` otherwise.

Question 3: How can you implement a simple class in Python?
Answer: To implement a simple class in Python, you can use the `class` keyword followed by the class name and a colon. Inside the class, you can define an `__init__` method to initialize the object's attributes and other methods to define its behavior. Here’s a basic example:

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # instance variable for the dog's name
        self.age = age    # instance variable for the dog's age

    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"

# Creating an instance of the Dog class
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)

# Accessing attributes and methods
print(my_dog.name)  # Output: Buddy
print(my_dog.bark())  # Output: Buddy says woof!
```

In this example, we define a `Dog` class with an initializer that takes `name` and `age` as parameters. The `bark` method allows the dog to "speak." We then create an instance of the `Dog` class and demonstrate how to access its attributes and methods.

Question 4: How do you read a CSV file and convert it into a list of dictionaries in Python?
Answer: You can read a CSV file and convert it into a list of dictionaries in Python using the `csv` module. Here’s an example of how to do this:

```python
import csv

# Define the path to your CSV file
csv_file_path = 'your_file.csv'

# Initialize an empty list to store the dictionaries
data_list = []

# Open the CSV file
with open(csv_file_path, mode='r', newline='') as csvfile:
    # Create a CSV reader object
    csv_reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)
    
    # Iterate over each row in the CSV file
    for row in csv_reader:
        # Append the row (as a dictionary) to the list
        data_list.append(row)

# Now data_list contains the CSV data as a list of dictionaries
print(data_list)
```

In this code:
- `csv.DictReader` reads the CSV file and maps the information in each row to a dictionary using the header row as keys.
- Each row is appended to the `data_list`, resulting in a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a row in the CSV file.

Question 5: How can you implement a basic sorting algorithm (like bubble sort) in Python?
Answer: You can implement a basic sorting algorithm like bubble sort in Python using the following code:

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Traverse through all array elements
    for i in range(n):
        # Last i elements are already sorted
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            # Traverse the array from 0 to n-i-1
            # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]

# Example usage
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
bubble_sort(arr)
print("Sorted array is:", arr)
```

In this implementation, the `bubble_sort` function takes a list `arr` as input and sorts it in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm. The algorithm repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.

INFO - [Task id] 50 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
Write a Python function that takes a list of strings and returns the longest string in the list. If there are multiple strings of the same maximum length, return the first one encountered. If the list is empty, return None.
INFO - [Task id] 50 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of finding the longest string in a list of strings in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a list of strings as an argument.

2. **Check for Empty List**: Inside the function, first check if the list is empty. If it is, return `None`.

3. **Initialize Variables**: Create a variable to keep track of the longest string found so far. You can initialize it to `None` or an empty string.

4. **Iterate Through the List**: Use a loop to iterate through each string in the list.

5. **Compare Lengths**: For each string, compare its length to the length of the current longest string. If the current string is longer, update the longest string variable to this new string.

6. **Return the Result**: After finishing the loop, return the longest string found.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def find_longest_string(strings):
    if not strings:  # Step 2: Check for empty list
        return None
    
    longest_string = ""  # Step 3: Initialize longest string variable
    
    for string in strings:  # Step 4: Iterate through the list
        if len(string) > len(longest_string):  # Step 5: Compare lengths
            longest_string = string  # Update longest string
    
    return longest_string  # Step 6: Return the result
```

This function will effectively find and return the longest string from the provided list, adhering to the specified conditions.

INFO - [Task id] 50 [generation text] Explain: The rough plan provided is mostly correct and outlines the necessary steps to accomplish the task. However, the initialization of the `longest_string` variable should be set to `None` instead of an empty string to handle cases where the list might contain only empty strings.

[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

def find_longest_string(strings):
    if (not strings):
        return None
    longest_string = None
    for string in strings:
        if ((longest_string is None) or (len(string) > len(longest_string))):
            longest_string = string
    return longest_string


The main function is `find_longest_string`.
INFO - [Task id] 50 [generation text] This function takes a list of strings as input and returns the longest string from that list. If the list is empty, it returns None. It initializes a variable to keep track of the longest string found so far. As it iterates through each string in the list, it updates the longest string if the current string is longer than the previously recorded longest string. Finally, it returns the longest string after checking all the elements in the list. The function effectively handles cases where the input list may be empty.
