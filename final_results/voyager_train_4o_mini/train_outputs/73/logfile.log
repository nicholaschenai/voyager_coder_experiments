You are a helpful assistant that asks questions to help me decide the next immediate task to do for Python programming.
My ultimate goal is to solve as many diverse problems as possible and become the best programmer in the world.

I will give you the following information:
Completed tasks so far: ...
Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should ask at least 5 questions (but no more than 10 questions) to help me decide the next immediate task to do. Each question should be followed by the concept that the question is about.
2) Your question should be specific to a concept in Python programming.
  Bad example (the question is too general):
    Question: What is the best way to program in Python?
    Concept: unknown
  Good example:
    Question: How do you reverse a list?
    Concept: list
3) Your questions should be self-contained and not require any context.

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Question: ...

You will answer the question based on the context (only if available and helpful) and your own knowledge of Python programming.
1) Start your answer with "Answer: ".
2) Answer "Answer: Unknown" if you don't know the answer.

INFO - [Task id] 73 [prompt] Question: How can you create a tuple from a list in Python?
INFO - [Task id] 73 [generation text] Answer: You can create a tuple from a list in Python by using the `tuple()` constructor. Here’s an example:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
my_tuple = tuple(my_list)
print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4)
```

This code takes a list called `my_list` and converts it into a tuple called `my_tuple`.

Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. As a rule of thumb, guide me through beginner problems, followed by interview level problems, followed by competitive programming problems. The latter 2 levels can involve concepts from data structures and algorithms.
2) Please be very specific about what skills I need to learn.
3) Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for problems which I have not solved yet. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) The task should involve writing a main Python function that at most use basic libraries (try not to import too many or too advanced modules)
7) Do not give tasks that require file operations (create, read, update, delete) or an internet connection.
8) I am only allowed to write Python functions, so do not require me to write other things (e.g. objects). 
9) Requiring me to write a function that takes in an object and uses object methods is still ok, but I cannot define the objects myself. You must provide the objects as input to my function in the assert statement.

Take note of these in your response:
1) Give an expected function name for the task.
2) Give a tuple of 3 assert statements that tests the function's correctness in the "test_tuple" field. This must strictly contain single-line assert statements only; any setup code for the test must be filled in the "test_setup_code" field.
3) The function name which you gave must be called in the assert statements. 

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}

    ]
}

INFO - [Task id] 73 [prompt] Question 1: How do you find the intersection of two sets in Python?
Answer: You can find the intersection of two sets in Python using the `intersection()` method or the `&` operator. Here are examples of both methods:

Using the `intersection()` method:
```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}
intersection = set1.intersection(set2)
print(intersection)  # Output: {3, 4}
```

Using the `&` operator:
```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}
intersection = set1 & set2
print(intersection)  # Output: {3, 4}
```

Both methods will give you the same result, which is the set of elements that are present in both sets.

Question 2: How can you create a tuple from a list in Python?
Answer: You can create a tuple from a list in Python by using the `tuple()` constructor. Here’s an example:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
my_tuple = tuple(my_list)
print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4)
```

This code takes a list called `my_list` and converts it into a tuple called `my_tuple`.

Question 3: How do you check if a string contains only digits?
Answer: You can check if a string contains only digits in Python by using the `isdigit()` method. Here’s an example:

```python
my_string = "12345"
if my_string.isdigit():
    print("The string contains only digits.")
else:
    print("The string contains non-digit characters.")
```

The `isdigit()` method returns `True` if all characters in the string are digits and there is at least one character, otherwise it returns `False`.

Question 4: How do you generate all permutations of a list in Python?
Answer: You can generate all permutations of a list in Python using the `itertools` module, specifically the `permutations` function. Here’s an example of how to use it:

```python
import itertools

# Example list
my_list = [1, 2, 3]

# Generate all permutations
permutations_list = list(itertools.permutations(my_list))

# Print the permutations
for perm in permutations_list:
    print(perm)
```

This will output all possible permutations of the list `[1, 2, 3]`. The `permutations` function returns an iterator of tuples, each representing a different permutation. You can convert it to a list if you need to store or manipulate the permutations further.

Question 5: What is the best way to sort a list of dictionaries by a specific key?
Answer: The best way to sort a list of dictionaries by a specific key in Python is to use the `sorted()` function along with a lambda function as the key argument. Here’s an example:

```python
list_of_dicts = [
    {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30},
    {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 25},
    {'name': 'Charlie', 'age': 35}
]

# Sort by the 'age' key
sorted_list = sorted(list_of_dicts, key=lambda x: x['age'])

print(sorted_list)
```

This will output:

```
[{'name': 'Bob', 'age': 25}, {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}, {'name': 'Charlie', 'age': 35}]
```

You can also sort in reverse order by adding the `reverse=True` argument:

```python
sorted_list_desc = sorted(list_of_dicts, key=lambda x: x['age'], reverse=True)
```

This will sort the list in descending order based on the 'age' key.

INFO - [Task id] 73 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
Write a Python function that takes a string and returns a new string where each word is capitalized (the first letter of each word is uppercase and the rest are lowercase).
INFO - [Task id] 73 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of capitalizing each word in a string in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a single string as an argument.

2. **Split the String**: Use the `split()` method to break the string into individual words. This method will create a list of words based on spaces.

3. **Capitalize Each Word**: Iterate over the list of words and capitalize each word. You can use the `capitalize()` method, which converts the first character of the string to uppercase and the rest to lowercase.

4. **Join the Words**: After capitalizing each word, use the `join()` method to combine the list of capitalized words back into a single string, with spaces in between.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the newly created string.

Here is a simple example of how the function might look:

```python
def capitalize_words(input_string):
    words = input_string.split()  # Step 2
    capitalized_words = [word.capitalize() for word in words]  # Step 3
    return ' '.join(capitalized_words)  # Step 4
```

This function will take an input string, capitalize each word, and return the modified string.

You are a Python programming assistant that assesses my progress of Python programming and provides useful guidance.

I will give you the following information:

[Task]: The objective I need to accomplish.
[Context]: The context of the task. Serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help me on the task, but my priority is to follow instructions in the Task tag.
[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

You should only respond in JSON format as described below:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.
