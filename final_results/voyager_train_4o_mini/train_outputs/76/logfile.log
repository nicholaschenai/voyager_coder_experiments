You are a helpful assistant that asks questions to help me decide the next immediate task to do for Python programming.
My ultimate goal is to solve as many diverse problems as possible and become the best programmer in the world.

I will give you the following information:
Completed tasks so far: ...
Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should ask at least 5 questions (but no more than 10 questions) to help me decide the next immediate task to do. Each question should be followed by the concept that the question is about.
2) Your question should be specific to a concept in Python programming.
  Bad example (the question is too general):
    Question: What is the best way to program in Python?
    Concept: unknown
  Good example:
    Question: How do you reverse a list?
    Concept: list
3) Your questions should be self-contained and not require any context.

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.

You are a helpful assistant that tells me the next immediate task (in the form of a function) to do for Python programming. 
My ultimate goal is to solve as many diverse problems as possible and become the best programmer in the world.

I will give you the following information:
Question 1: ...
Answer: ...
Question 2: ...
Answer: ...
Question 3: ...
Answer: ...

Completed tasks so far: ...
Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. As a rule of thumb, guide me through beginner problems, followed by interview level problems, followed by competitive programming problems. The latter 2 levels can involve concepts from data structures and algorithms.
2) Please be very specific about what skills I need to learn.
3) Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for problems which I have not solved yet. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) The task should involve writing a main Python function that at most use basic libraries (try not to import too many or too advanced modules)
7) Do not give tasks that require file operations (create, read, update, delete) or an internet connection.
8) I am only allowed to write Python functions, so do not require me to write other things (e.g. objects). 
9) Requiring me to write a function that takes in an object and uses object methods is still ok, but I cannot define the objects myself. You must provide the objects as input to my function in the assert statement.

Take note of these in your response:
1) Give an expected function name for the task.
2) Give a tuple of 3 assert statements that tests the function's correctness in the "test_tuple" field. This must strictly contain single-line assert statements only; any setup code for the test must be filled in the "test_setup_code" field.
3) The function name which you gave must be called in the assert statements. 

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:

        "assert find_zero_sum([1, 4, 3, -4, -1]) == (4, -4)"
    ]
}

INFO - [Task id] 76 [prompt] Question 1: How do you find the intersection of two sets in Python?
Answer: You can find the intersection of two sets in Python using the `intersection()` method or the `&` operator. Here are examples of both methods:

Using the `intersection()` method:
```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}
intersection = set1.intersection(set2)
print(intersection)  # Output: {3, 4}
```

Using the `&` operator:
```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}
intersection = set1 & set2
print(intersection)  # Output: {3, 4}
```

Both methods will give you the same result, which is the set of elements that are present in both sets.

Question 2: How can you create a tuple from a list in Python?
Answer: You can create a tuple from a list in Python by using the `tuple()` constructor. Here’s an example:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
my_tuple = tuple(my_list)
print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4)
```

This code takes a list called `my_list` and converts it into a tuple called `my_tuple`.

Question 3: How do you check if a string contains only digits?
Answer: You can check if a string contains only digits in Python by using the `isdigit()` method. Here’s an example:

```python
my_string = "12345"
if my_string.isdigit():
    print("The string contains only digits.")
else:
    print("The string contains non-digit characters.")
```

The `isdigit()` method returns `True` if all characters in the string are digits and there is at least one character, otherwise it returns `False`.

Question 4: How do you implement a function that checks if a number is prime?
Answer: To implement a function that checks if a number is prime in Python, you can follow these steps:

1. A prime number is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
2. You can check for divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.

Here is a sample implementation:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

You can use this function by passing an integer to it, and it will return `True` if the number is prime and `False` otherwise. For example:

```python
print(is_prime(11))  # Output: True
print(is_prime(4))   # Output: False
```

Question 5: What is the best way to sort a list of dictionaries by a specific key?
Answer: The best way to sort a list of dictionaries by a specific key in Python is to use the `sorted()` function along with a lambda function as the key argument. Here’s an example:

```python
list_of_dicts = [
    {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30},
    {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 25},
    {'name': 'Charlie', 'age': 35}
]

# Sort by the 'age' key
sorted_list = sorted(list_of_dicts, key=lambda x: x['age'])

print(sorted_list)
```

This will output:

```
[{'name': 'Bob', 'age': 25}, {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}, {'name': 'Charlie', 'age': 35}]
```

You can also sort in reverse order by adding the `reverse=True` argument:

```python
sorted_list_desc = sorted(list_of_dicts, key=lambda x: x['age'], reverse=True)
```

This will sort the list in descending order based on the 'age' key.

INFO - [Task id] 76 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
Write a Python function that takes a string containing parentheses and returns True if the parentheses are balanced (every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis), and False otherwise.
INFO - [Task id] 76 [generation text] Answer: To determine if a string containing parentheses is balanced, you can use a stack data structure. The basic idea is to iterate through each character in the string and perform the following steps:

1. **Initialize a Stack**: Create an empty list to use as a stack.

2. **Iterate Through the String**: Loop through each character in the input string.

3. **Push Opening Parentheses**: If the character is an opening parenthesis `(`, push it onto the stack.

4. **Pop for Closing Parentheses**: If the character is a closing parenthesis `)`, check if the stack is not empty. If it is not empty, pop the top element from the stack (which should be a matching opening parenthesis). If the stack is empty, it means there is no corresponding opening parenthesis, and you can return False.

5. **Final Check**: After processing all characters, check if the stack is empty. If it is empty, it means all opening parentheses had matching closing parentheses, so return True. If there are still elements in the stack, return False.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def is_balanced(parentheses_string):
    stack = []
    
    for char in parentheses_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(char)  # Push opening parenthesis onto the stack
        elif char == ')':
            if stack:  # Check if stack is not empty
                stack.pop()  # Pop the last opening parenthesis
            else:
                return False  # No matching opening parenthesis
    
    return len(stack) == 0  # Return True if stack is empty, else False
```

This function effectively checks for balanced parentheses by ensuring that every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis in the correct order.

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

The main function is `is_balanced_parentheses`.
INFO - [Task id] 76 [generation text] This function checks if a given string of parentheses is balanced. It uses a stack to keep track of opening parentheses. For each character in the string, it pushes an opening parenthesis onto the stack and pops from the stack for each closing parenthesis. If a closing parenthesis is encountered when the stack is empty, it returns false, indicating an imbalance. At the end, it checks if the stack is empty, returning true if balanced and false otherwise. This ensures that every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one in the correct order.
