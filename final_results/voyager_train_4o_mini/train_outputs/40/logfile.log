You are a helpful assistant that asks questions to help me decide the next immediate task to do for Python programming.
My ultimate goal is to solve as many diverse problems as possible and become the best programmer in the world.

I will give you the following information:
Completed tasks so far: ...
Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should ask at least 5 questions (but no more than 10 questions) to help me decide the next immediate task to do. Each question should be followed by the concept that the question is about.
2) Your question should be specific to a concept in Python programming.
  Bad example (the question is too general):
    Question: What is the best way to program in Python?
    Concept: unknown
  Good example:
    Question: How do you reverse a list?
    Concept: list
3) Your questions should be self-contained and not require any context.

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Question: ...

You will answer the question based on the context (only if available and helpful) and your own knowledge of Python programming.
1) Start your answer with "Answer: ".
2) Answer "Answer: Unknown" if you don't know the answer.

INFO - [Task id] 40 [prompt] Question: How do you reverse the words in a string while preserving their order in Python?
INFO - [Task id] 40 [generation text] Answer: You can reverse the words in a string while preserving their order by splitting the string into words, reversing the list of words, and then joining them back together. Here’s a simple example:

```python
def reverse_words(input_string):
    # Split the string into words
    words = input_string.split()
    # Reverse the list of words
    reversed_words = words[::-1]
    # Join the reversed list back into a string
    return ' '.join(reversed_words)

# Example usage
input_string = "Hello world this is Python"
result = reverse_words(input_string)
print(result)  # Output: "Python is this world Hello"
```

In this code, `split()` is used to break the string into a list of words, `[::-1]` reverses the list, and `join()` combines the words back into a single string.

INFO - [Task id] 40 [prompt] Question: How do you generate Fibonacci numbers in Python?
INFO - [Task id] 40 [generation text] Answer: You can generate Fibonacci numbers in Python using various methods. Here are a few common approaches:

1. **Using a loop**:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    fib_sequence = []
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        fib_sequence.append(a)
        a, b = b, a + b
    return fib_sequence

# Example usage:
print(fibonacci(10))  # Generates the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
```

2. **Using recursion**:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    else:
        fib_sequence = fibonacci(n - 1)
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
        return fib_sequence

# Example usage:
print(fibonacci(10))  # Generates the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
```

3. **Using a generator**:
```python
def fibonacci_generator(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

# Example usage:
print(list(fibonacci_generator(10)))  # Generates the first 10 Fibonacci numbers

INFO - [Task id] 40 [prompt] Question: How do you swap keys and values in a dictionary while handling duplicates in Python?
INFO - [Task id] 40 [generation text] Answer: To swap keys and values in a dictionary while handling duplicates, you can use a `defaultdict` from the `collections` module. This allows you to group values that share the same key after the swap. Here's an example of how to do this:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def swap_dict(d):
    swapped = defaultdict(list)
    for key, value in d.items():
        swapped[value].append(key)
    return dict(swapped)

# Example usage
original_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 1}
swapped_dict = swap_dict(original_dict)
print(swapped_dict)
```

In this example, the original dictionary has keys 'a' and 'c' both mapping to the value `1`. After swapping, the resulting dictionary will have `1` as a key with a list of its original keys: `{'1': ['a', 'c'], '2': ['b']}`. This way, you can handle duplicates effectively.

Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. As a rule of thumb, guide me through beginner problems, followed by interview level problems, followed by competitive programming problems. The latter 2 levels can involve concepts from data structures and algorithms.
2) Please be very specific about what skills I need to learn.
3) Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for problems which I have not solved yet. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) The task should involve writing a main Python function that at most use basic libraries (try not to import too many or too advanced modules)
7) Do not give tasks that require file operations (create, read, update, delete) or an internet connection.
8) I am only allowed to write Python functions, so do not require me to write other things (e.g. objects). 
9) Requiring me to write a function that takes in an object and uses object methods is still ok, but I cannot define the objects myself. You must provide the objects as input to my function in the assert statement.

Take note of these in your response:
1) Give an expected function name for the task.
2) Give a tuple of 3 assert statements that tests the function's correctness in the "test_tuple" field. This must strictly contain single-line assert statements only; any setup code for the test must be filled in the "test_setup_code" field.
3) The function name which you gave must be called in the assert statements. 

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}

        "assert find_zero_sum([1, 4, 3, -4, -1]) == (4, -4)"
    ]
}

INFO - [Task id] 40 [prompt] Question 1: What is the best way to check if a number is prime in Python?
Answer: The best way to check if a number is prime in Python is to use a function that tests for primality by checking divisibility. Here is a simple and efficient implementation:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
```

This function first handles small numbers and then checks for factors up to the square root of `n`, skipping even numbers and multiples of 3 for efficiency.

Question 2: How do you find the union of two sets in Python?
Answer: You can find the union of two sets in Python using the `union()` method or the `|` operator. Here’s how you can do it:

Using the `union()` method:
```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}
union_set = set1.union(set2)
print(union_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

Using the `|` operator:
```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}
union_set = set1 | set2
print(union_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

Both methods will give you the same result, which is the union of the two sets.

Question 3: How do you reverse the words in a string while preserving their order in Python?
Answer: You can reverse the words in a string while preserving their order by splitting the string into words, reversing the list of words, and then joining them back together. Here’s a simple example:

```python
def reverse_words(input_string):
    # Split the string into words
    words = input_string.split()
    # Reverse the list of words
    reversed_words = words[::-1]
    # Join the reversed list back into a string
    return ' '.join(reversed_words)

# Example usage
input_string = "Hello world this is Python"
result = reverse_words(input_string)
print(result)  # Output: "Python is this world Hello"
```

In this code, `split()` is used to break the string into a list of words, `[::-1]` reverses the list, and `join()` combines the words back into a single string.

Question 4: How do you generate Fibonacci numbers in Python?
Answer: You can generate Fibonacci numbers in Python using various methods. Here are a few common approaches:

1. **Using a loop**:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    fib_sequence = []
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        fib_sequence.append(a)
        a, b = b, a + b
    return fib_sequence

# Example usage:
print(fibonacci(10))  # Generates the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
```

2. **Using recursion**:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    else:
        fib_sequence = fibonacci(n - 1)
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
        return fib_sequence

# Example usage:
print(fibonacci(10))  # Generates the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
```

3. **Using a generator**:
```python
def fibonacci_generator(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

# Example usage:
print(list(fibonacci_generator(10)))  # Generates the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
```

Question 5: How do you swap keys and values in a dictionary while handling duplicates in Python?
Answer: To swap keys and values in a dictionary while handling duplicates, you can use a `defaultdict` from the `collections` module. This allows you to group values that share the same key after the swap. Here's an example of how to do this:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def swap_dict(d):
    swapped = defaultdict(list)
    for key, value in d.items():
        swapped[value].append(key)
    return dict(swapped)

# Example usage
original_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 1}
swapped_dict = swap_dict(original_dict)
print(swapped_dict)
```

In this example, the original dictionary has keys 'a' and 'c' both mapping to the value `1`. After swapping, the resulting dictionary will have `1` as a key with a list of its original keys: `{'1': ['a', 'c'], '2': ['b']}`. This way, you can handle duplicates effectively.

INFO - [Task id] 40 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a dictionary where the keys are the integers from the list and the values are the squares of those integers.
INFO - [Task id] 40 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of creating a function that takes a list of integers and returns a dictionary with the integers as keys and their squares as values, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function that accepts a list of integers as an argument.

2. **Initialize an Empty Dictionary**: Inside the function, create an empty dictionary that will hold the keys and values.

3. **Iterate Over the List**: Use a loop to iterate through each integer in the provided list.

4. **Calculate the Square**: For each integer, calculate its square by multiplying the integer by itself.

5. **Add to the Dictionary**: Add an entry to the dictionary where the key is the integer and the value is its square.

6. **Return the Dictionary**: After the loop completes, return the populated dictionary.

Here is a simple example of how the function might look in code:

```python
def square_dict(int_list):
    result = {}
    for num in int_list:
        result[num] = num ** 2
    return result
```

In this example, `int_list` is the input list of integers, and `result` is the dictionary that will be returned, containing each integer and its square.

[Task]
Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a dictionary where the keys are the integers from the list and the values are the squares of those integers.
You must strictly follow the function name: squares_dict

[Context]
Rough plan to accomplish the task (can be wrong): 
Answer: To accomplish the task of creating a function that takes a list of integers and returns a dictionary with the integers as keys and their squares as values, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining a function that accepts a list of integers as an argument.

2. **Initialize an Empty Dictionary**: Inside the function, create an empty dictionary that will hold the keys and values.

3. **Iterate Over the List**: Use a loop to iterate through each integer in the provided list.

4. **Calculate the Square**: For each integer, calculate its square by multiplying the integer by itself.

5. **Add to the Dictionary**: Add an entry to the dictionary where the key is the integer and the value is its square.

6. **Return the Dictionary**: After the loop completes, return the populated dictionary.

Here is a simple example of how the function might look in code:

```python
def square_dict(int_list):
    result = {}
    for num in int_list:
        result[num] = num ** 2
    return result
```

In this example, `int_list` is the input list of integers, and `result` is the dictionary that will be returned, containing each integer and its square.

You are a Python programming assistant that assesses my progress of Python programming and provides useful guidance.

I will give you the following information:

[Task]: The objective I need to accomplish.
[Context]: The context of the task. Serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help me on the task, but my priority is to follow instructions in the Task tag.
[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

You should only respond in JSON format as described below:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.
