You are a helpful assistant that asks questions to help me decide the next immediate task to do for Python programming.
My ultimate goal is to solve as many diverse problems as possible and become the best programmer in the world.

I will give you the following information:
Completed tasks so far: ...
Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should ask at least 5 questions (but no more than 10 questions) to help me decide the next immediate task to do. Each question should be followed by the concept that the question is about.
2) Your question should be specific to a concept in Python programming.
  Bad example (the question is too general):
    Question: What is the best way to program in Python?
    Concept: unknown
  Good example:
    Question: How do you reverse a list?
    Concept: list
3) Your questions should be self-contained and not require any context.

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

You are a helpful assistant that tells me the next immediate task (in the form of a function) to do for Python programming. 
My ultimate goal is to solve as many diverse problems as possible and become the best programmer in the world.

Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. As a rule of thumb, guide me through beginner problems, followed by interview level problems, followed by competitive programming problems. The latter 2 levels can involve concepts from data structures and algorithms.
2) Please be very specific about what skills I need to learn.
3) Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for problems which I have not solved yet. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) The task should involve writing a main Python function that at most use basic libraries (try not to import too many or too advanced modules)
7) Do not give tasks that require file operations (create, read, update, delete) or an internet connection.
8) I am only allowed to write Python functions, so do not require me to write other things (e.g. objects). 
9) Requiring me to write a function that takes in an object and uses object methods is still ok, but I cannot define the objects myself. You must provide the objects as input to my function in the assert statement.

Take note of these in your response:
1) Give an expected function name for the task.
2) Give a tuple of 3 assert statements that tests the function's correctness in the "test_tuple" field. This must strictly contain single-line assert statements only; any setup code for the test must be filled in the "test_setup_code" field.
3) The function name which you gave must be called in the assert statements. 

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.

        "assert find_zero_sum([1, 4, 3, -4, -1]) == (4, -4)"
    ]
}

INFO - [Task id] 59 [prompt] Question 1: How do you swap keys and values in a dictionary while handling duplicate values?
Answer: To swap keys and values in a dictionary while handling duplicate values, you can use a `defaultdict` from the `collections` module. This allows you to group keys that have the same value into a list. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def swap_dict(d):
    swapped = defaultdict(list)
    for key, value in d.items():
        swapped[value].append(key)
    return dict(swapped)

# Example usage
original_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 1}
swapped_dict = swap_dict(original_dict)
print(swapped_dict)
```

In this example, the original dictionary has keys 'a' and 'c' with the same value of 1. The resulting dictionary will have the value 1 associated with a list of keys `['a', 'c']`, and the value 2 associated with the key `['b']`. The output will be:

```
{1: ['a', 'c'], 2: ['b']}
```

This way, you can effectively handle duplicate values when swapping keys and values in a dictionary.

Question 2: What is the method to filter a dictionary to include only items where the value exceeds a certain threshold?
Answer: You can filter a dictionary in Python using a dictionary comprehension. To include only items where the value exceeds a certain threshold, you can do the following:

```python
original_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 5, 'c': 3, 'd': 7}
threshold = 4

filtered_dict = {key: value for key, value in original_dict.items() if value > threshold}
```

In this example, `filtered_dict` will contain only the items from `original_dict` where the value is greater than 4. The resulting `filtered_dict` will be `{'b': 5, 'd': 7}`.

Question 3: What is the best way to generate all possible pairs of integers from a list?
Answer: The best way to generate all possible pairs of integers from a list in Python is to use the `itertools.combinations` function, which generates all possible combinations of a specified length from the input iterable. For pairs, you would specify a length of 2. Here's an example:

```python
import itertools

# Sample list of integers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Generate all possible pairs
pairs = list(itertools.combinations(numbers, 2))

print(pairs)
```

This will output:

```
[(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)]
```

If you want to include pairs where the order matters (i.e., (1, 2) and (2, 1) are considered different), you can use `itertools.permutations` instead:

```python
import itertools

# Sample list of integers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Generate all possible ordered pairs
ordered_pairs = list(itertools.permutations(numbers, 2))

print(ordered_pairs)
```

This will output:

```
[(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)]
```

Choose the method that best fits your needs!

Question 4: How do you remove all consonants from a string?
Answer: You can remove all consonants from a string in Python by using a combination of string methods and list comprehensions. Here's an example of how to do this:

```python
def remove_consonants(input_string):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    return ''.join([char for char in input_string if char in vowels or not char.isalpha()])

# Example usage
input_str = "Hello, World!"
result = remove_consonants(input_str)
print(result)  # Output: "eoo, o!"
```

In this code, we define a function `remove_consonants` that checks each character in the input string. If the character is a vowel or not an alphabetic character (like punctuation or spaces), it is included in the result. All consonants are effectively removed.

Question 5: How can you count the occurrences of vowels in a string and return a dictionary of those counts?
Answer: You can count the occurrences of vowels in a string and return a dictionary of those counts by using a simple loop or a dictionary comprehension. Here’s an example of how to do this in Python:

```python
def count_vowels(s):
    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
    vowel_count = {v: 0 for v in vowels}  # Initialize a dictionary with vowels as keys

    for char in s:
        if char in vowel_count:
            vowel_count[char] += 1  # Increment the count for the vowel

    return vowel_count

# Example usage
input_string = "Hello World"
result = count_vowels(input_string)
print(result)
```

In this code:
- We define a function `count_vowels` that takes a string `s` as input.
- We create a dictionary `vowel_count` with vowels as keys and initialize their counts to 0.
- We iterate through each character in the string, and if the character is a vowel, we increment its count in the dictionary.
- Finally, we return the dictionary containing the counts of each vowel.

INFO - [Task id] 59 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
Write a Python function that takes a string and returns a new string with all the digits removed.
INFO - [Task id] 59 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of removing all digits from a string in Python, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Define a Function**: Start by defining a function that takes a single string parameter.

2. **Iterate Through the String**: Use a loop to go through each character in the string.

3. **Check for Digits**: For each character, check if it is a digit. In Python, you can use the `str.isdigit()` method to determine if a character is a digit.

4. **Build a New String**: If the character is not a digit, append it to a new string (or use a list to collect non-digit characters and then join them at the end).

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the new string that contains only the non-digit characters.

Here is a simple example of how this could be implemented:

```python
def remove_digits(input_string):
    result = ''.join(char for char in input_string if not char.isdigit())
    return result
```

In this example, a generator expression is used to filter out digits, and `str.join()` is used to create the final string. This approach is efficient and concise.

You are a Python programming assistant that assesses my progress of Python programming and provides useful guidance.

I will give you the following information:

[Task]: The objective I need to accomplish.
[Context]: The context of the task. Serves as a casual tip (which can be wrong) to help me on the task, but my priority is to follow instructions in the Task tag.
[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)
