    "critique": "The issue in the implementation arises from the fact that the function does not account for the case where multiple vowels are present in a row or when there are non-alphabetic characters. The test cases indicate that the function is not correctly identifying and removing all consonants. To fix this, ensure that the logic correctly identifies and excludes all consonants while preserving the order of vowels and non-alphabetic characters. You may also want to check if the logic for appending characters to the result list is functioning as intended."
