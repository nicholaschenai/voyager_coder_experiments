You are a helpful assistant that asks questions to help me decide the next immediate task to do for Python programming.
My ultimate goal is to solve as many diverse problems as possible and become the best programmer in the world.

I will give you the following information:
Completed tasks so far: ...
Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should ask at least 5 questions (but no more than 10 questions) to help me decide the next immediate task to do. Each question should be followed by the concept that the question is about.
2) Your question should be specific to a concept in Python programming.
  Bad example (the question is too general):
    Question: What is the best way to program in Python?
    Concept: unknown
  Good example:
    Question: How do you reverse a list?
    Concept: list
3) Your questions should be self-contained and not require any context.

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

You are a helpful assistant that tells me the next immediate task (in the form of a function) to do for Python programming. 
My ultimate goal is to solve as many diverse problems as possible and become the best programmer in the world.

Failed tasks that are too hard: ...

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. As a rule of thumb, guide me through beginner problems, followed by interview level problems, followed by competitive programming problems. The latter 2 levels can involve concepts from data structures and algorithms.
2) Please be very specific about what skills I need to learn.
3) Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for problems which I have not solved yet. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) The task should involve writing a main Python function that at most use basic libraries (try not to import too many or too advanced modules)
7) Do not give tasks that require file operations (create, read, update, delete) or an internet connection.
8) I am only allowed to write Python functions, so do not require me to write other things (e.g. objects). 
9) Requiring me to write a function that takes in an object and uses object methods is still ok, but I cannot define the objects myself. You must provide the objects as input to my function in the assert statement.

Take note of these in your response:
1) Give an expected function name for the task.
2) Give a tuple of 3 assert statements that tests the function's correctness in the "test_tuple" field. This must strictly contain single-line assert statements only; any setup code for the test must be filled in the "test_setup_code" field.
3) The function name which you gave must be called in the assert statements. 

Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.


Response format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:

        "assert find_zero_sum([1, 4, 3, -4, -1]) == (4, -4)"
    ]
}

INFO - [Task id] 80 [prompt] Question 1: How do you find the intersection of two sets in Python?
Answer: You can find the intersection of two sets in Python using the `intersection()` method or the `&` operator. Here are examples of both methods:

Using the `intersection()` method:
```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}
intersection = set1.intersection(set2)
print(intersection)  # Output: {3, 4}
```

Using the `&` operator:
```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}
intersection = set1 & set2
print(intersection)  # Output: {3, 4}
```

Both methods will give you the same result, which is the set of elements that are present in both sets.

Question 2: How do you create a dictionary from two lists, one for keys and one for values?
Answer: You can create a dictionary from two lists in Python using the `zip()` function along with the `dict()` constructor. Here’s an example:

```python
keys = ['a', 'b', 'c']
values = [1, 2, 3]

# Create a dictionary using zip and dict
my_dict = dict(zip(keys, values))

print(my_dict)
```

This will output:

```
{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```

In this example, `zip(keys, values)` pairs each key with its corresponding value, and `dict()` converts those pairs into a dictionary.

Question 3: How do you check if a string contains only digits?
Answer: You can check if a string contains only digits in Python by using the `isdigit()` method. Here’s an example:

```python
my_string = "12345"
if my_string.isdigit():
    print("The string contains only digits.")
else:
    print("The string contains non-digit characters.")
```

The `isdigit()` method returns `True` if all characters in the string are digits and there is at least one character, otherwise it returns `False`.

Question 4: How do you generate all permutations of a list in Python?
Answer: You can generate all permutations of a list in Python using the `itertools` module, specifically the `permutations` function. Here’s an example of how to use it:

```python
import itertools

# Example list
my_list = [1, 2, 3]

# Generate all permutations
permutations_list = list(itertools.permutations(my_list))

# Print the permutations
for perm in permutations_list:
    print(perm)
```

This will output all possible permutations of the list `[1, 2, 3]`. The `permutations` function returns an iterator of tuples, each representing a different permutation. You can convert it to a list if you need to store or manipulate the permutations further.

Question 5: How do you remove duplicates from a list while preserving the order of elements?
Answer: You can remove duplicates from a list while preserving the order of elements by using a combination of a loop and a set to track seen elements. Here’s a simple way to do it:

```python
def remove_duplicates(input_list):
    seen = set()
    result = []
    for item in input_list:
        if item not in seen:
            seen.add(item)
            result.append(item)
    return result

# Example usage
my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
unique_list = remove_duplicates(my_list)
print(unique_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

This function iterates through the original list, adds each item to a set if it hasn't been seen before, and appends it to the result list, thus preserving the order of the first occurrences.

INFO - [Task id] 80 [prompt] Question: Explain at a conceptual level, how to accomplish the below task in Python programming?
Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a set containing the integers that appear more than once in the list.
INFO - [Task id] 80 [generation text] Answer: To accomplish the task of identifying integers that appear more than once in a list, you can follow these conceptual steps:

1. **Initialize a Set for Duplicates**: Create an empty set to store the integers that are found to be duplicates.

2. **Use a Dictionary to Count Occurrences**: Utilize a dictionary to keep track of how many times each integer appears in the list. The keys of the dictionary will be the integers, and the values will be their respective counts.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Loop through each integer in the input list. For each integer:
   - If it is already in the dictionary, increment its count.
   - If it is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1.

4. **Identify Duplicates**: After populating the dictionary, iterate through the dictionary items. If the count of any integer is greater than 1, add that integer to the set of duplicates.

5. **Return the Set**: Finally, return the set containing all the integers that appeared more than once.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def find_duplicates(int_list):
    count_dict = {}
    duplicates = set()
    
    for num in int_list:
        if num in count_dict:

    for num, count in count_dict.items():
        if count > 1:
            duplicates.add(num)
    
    return duplicates
```

This function effectively counts the occurrences of each integer and collects those that appear more than once into a set, which is then returned.

[function impl]: My function implementation that is intended to complete the task
[unit test results]: The results after executing my function implementation on the unit tests

Your first goal is to use these info to evaluate if I have met the task requirements, and explain why. 
It is possible that the unit test results all pass, but the code does not accomplish the task (eg by failing to accomplish the task in scenarios not covered by the unit tests)
It is also possible that the unit tests are wrong in the first place, though the code accomplishes the task and fails the unit test.

If I have not met the task requirements, write a few sentences to explain why the function implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. 
You will need this as guidance when you try again later.
Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation. 
Suggest how the function implementation can be changed, NOT the test cases (assert statements)

4. **Identify Duplicates**: After populating the dictionary, iterate through the dictionary items. If the count of any integer is greater than 1, add that integer to the set of duplicates.

5. **Return the Set**: Finally, return the set containing all the integers that appeared more than once.

Here is a conceptual outline of the function:

```python
def find_duplicates(int_list):
    count_dict = {}
    duplicates = set()
    
    for num in int_list:
        if num in count_dict:
            count_dict[num] += 1
        else:
            count_dict[num] = 1
            
    for num, count in count_dict.items():
        if count > 1:
            duplicates.add(num)
    
    return duplicates
```

This function effectively counts the occurrences of each integer and collects those that appear more than once into a set, which is then returned.

    count_dict = {}
    duplicates = set()
    for num in int_list:
        if (num in count_dict):
            count_dict[num] += 1
        else:
            count_dict[num] = 1
    for (num, count) in count_dict.items():
        if (count > 1):
            duplicates.add(num)
    return duplicates

The main function is `find_duplicates`.
INFO - [Task id] 80 [generation text] This function takes a list of integers as input and identifies the duplicate numbers within that list. It utilizes a dictionary to count the occurrences of each integer. After counting, it checks which integers appear more than once and adds them to a set of duplicates. Finally, it returns this set of duplicate integers. The use of a set ensures that each duplicate is only listed once, regardless of how many times it appears in the input list. Overall, the function efficiently identifies and returns all duplicates from the provided list.
